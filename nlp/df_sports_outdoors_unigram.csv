We all tried them on an outing that included picnic lunch and hiking. Very handy they are as good as advertised. Tiny yet sturdy, and nice size when opened for use.

27,4.0,Very Smooth Reel,"I love to fish, especially when I am with my two sons who make perfect fishing buddies. One of them has taken to spinning reels, while the other prefers another type. So, with two of us in the family favoring spinning reels I was eager to try this reel to see how well it would hold up and perform for me. I have only one issue with it, relating to the spool, but in operation this is a very smooth and well-designed spinning reel.<br /><br />This is a smaller reel than what I normally use though this is not a problem for me. Instead of large bass, this reel works for me when I am after sunfish and perch. In spite of the small size, even in my big hands the bail does not scrape my knuckles as it spins. This is a plus for me as I have had this problem with smaller reels.<br /><br />I have two pet peeves with spinning reels that come up time and again. First, if the bail does not pass over the spindle far enough the line does not come off the spool very easily and it greatly reduces the casting distance, even more so than will a cheap rod with sub-par eyelets. This is not a problem with this reel and I have been able to get good casting distance with lightweight test.<br /><br />The other issue I have with reels that many fail to implement properly is a zero-reverse clutch. When engaged, there should be absolutely no play at all in the reel and there should be absolutely no reverse turning – period. A good number of reels allow a small amount of reverse in the turn which is unacceptable. This one gets it right and when the clutch is engaged there is no reverse at all.<br /><br />Many reels I have used have 9 or 10 ball bearings. This one has 12. Generally speaking, more ball bearings means smoother operation and returns. This is definitely a very smooth reel, arguably the smoothest reel I have ever used.<br /><br />There is one negative about this reel that merits mention. The spool is attractive and it has 14 diagonal openings that allow air flow and add to the appearance. These have very sharp ridges that you can feel when you run a finger across them and they are sharp enough that you can cleanly trim a fingernail on them. Normally this is not something I would really mind, except that in the event of a severe backlash you can nick or cut your line which is a more serious issue. If I can find a different spool that will fit I plan to replace it which would make this reel just about perfect.<br /><br />This is a nice, smaller reel. It gets the important things right – the bail flips properly and the zero-reverse clutch is excellent. It is very smooth too. The spool is the only issue and even then one might argue that I am being picky but it still merits mention. This reel will see more use as we get deeper into the summer.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

They also have basically no insulation, I put my hot coffee in it to try it out and it was very quickly too uncomfortably hot to hold in my hand. I can't see this working well in a cupholder, and its size also makes me think, why not just chug it if you want to carry around so little? 8oz is a very small amount.<br /><br />For camping purposes, I think there are much better collapsible cups out there, these do compress into a very nice small size, but I just can't see myself wanting to use these.<br /><br />Pulling them out and pushing them in also isn't the nicest, they are a more rigid material and once you have them fully extended, the bottoms aren't actually flat making them kind of unstable...so you have to hold them...with no insulation.

36,3.0,"The Trident...Just ""OK"".","Ahh, SOG.  I have many knives in the EDC (everyday carry) rotation.  I mostly prefer Spyderco as their designs and materials are preferred in my use.  I am not new to SOG, however.  I've owned EDCs and fixed blades that have been incredible values and exceptional users.  When I saw several SOG manufactured blades on Amazon this Holiday season for sale I thought it a prime opportunity to try out a few more examples.  Which brings me to the Trident.<br /><br />This is the black box version of the Trident.  It's not the full retail packaged item, but rather comes in a generic looking manufacturer's box from SOG.  I could care less about the retail box, so that's a non-issue.  What is an issue is the genuine disappointment upon opening and trying out the folder for the first time.  When comparing this item to other EDC blades from not only other manufacturers but SOG themselves the whole thing just comes across kind of &#34;meh&#34;.  I know this is an older design from the outfit, but it may be time to retire it. Despite it's lightweight, the knife just comes across bulky.  I could maybe give it a pass because of the 3.75&#34; blade, but the handle doesn't fit well in the hand and can be likened to carrying a 2x4.  Alright, that's a little far, but it's just an uncomfortable design to me.  Further inspection and this knife at the very least had some care taken in the build.  There is absolutely perfect blade centering in this particular example.<br /><br />Upon flicking open this massive 3.75&#34; blade, you want to be impressed.  The Trident fires off a little slow, though.  If you've ever held an AEGIS or Flashback you know how some of these SOG assisted openers can snap with real authority.  The Trident isn't one of them.  As for the steel, it's AUS-8, which isn't a super steel by any means but it's adequate in this application.  Extremely sharp out of the box which had sometimes been a problem with SOG in the past.  I'm not thrilled with the blade shape, though, not in my uses.  This is definitely more hiking folder than everyday use.  The pocket clip is a reversible low carry and sufficiently retains tight to the pocket, but I'm not fond of the way the whole thing carries.  Again, a bit too much bulk in the dimensions.  While we're on the handle again, the glass reinforced nylon that this is built from is too slick.  The gimping on top that leads to the blade is also not deep enough or poorly designed which causes thumb slip.  Why it's on the blade is a mystery, as those notches in retaining a firm grip are even less useful than the ones on the handle.  They need to either be deeper or more aggressive.  Probably both as they're too rounded and just cause slip.<br /><br />Another feature is the lock.  I find them redundant and wish SOG offered knife varieties without them, but there it is and I just leave it off.  The Trident is also known for its &#34;rope cutting&#34; notch in the handle.  I didn't try this feature out, but see it as a means to snagging on items and not lending itself a true benefit.  Perhaps I'm wrong on that, though, and I have no field use with that particular feature.<br /><br />I wanted to like the Trident.  It's lightweight, a long blade, and a well-crafted folder.  I just find myself dwelling on all of its shortcomings instead.  I paid a greatly reduced cost on this leading up to Christmas.  It was supposed to be a gift to my cousin.  Even at the reduced cost I think I'm going to send it back.  The whole product just comes across as barely adequate and there's just better folders out there in every category of use.  SOG even makes better carry knives with the Flashback and Aegis lines.  The Trident is just a miss from them in my opinion.  Choose something else, you'll be happy you did.",1,"['many', 'knife', 'carry', 'mostly', 'prefer', 'design', 'material', 'use', 'new', 'however', 'fixed', 'blade', 'value', 'user', 'saw', 'several', 'blade', 'amazon', 'season', 'thought', 'try', 'black', 'box', 'version', 'full', 'item', 'rather', 'come', 'looking', 'manufacturer', 'box', 'care', 'less', 'box', 'non', 'issue', 'issue', 'upon', 'opening', 'trying', 'first', 'time', 'item', 'blade', 'manufacturer', 'whole', 'thing', 'come', 'across', 'kind', 'know', 'older', 'design', 'may', 'time', 'despite', 'lightweight', 'knife', 'come', 'across', 'bulky', 'maybe', 'give', 'blade', 'handle', 'doe', 'fit', 'well', 'hand', 'carrying', 'little', 'far', 'uncomfortable', 'design', 'knife', 'least', 'care', 'taken', 'build', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'blade', 'upon', 'open', 'blade', 'want', 'impressed', 'fire', 'little', 'though', 'ever', 'held', 'know', 'snap', 'real', 'one', 'steel', 'super', 'steel', 'mean', 'extremely', 'sharp', 'box', 'sometimes', 'problem', 'past', 'blade', 'shape', 'though', 'definitely', 'hiking', 'use', 'pocket', 'clip', 'low', 'carry', 'tight', 'pocket', 'way', 'whole', 'thing', 'carry', 'bit', 'much', 'handle', 'glass', 'built', 'top', 'blade', 'also', 'deep', 'enough', 'designed', 'cause', 'slip', 'blade', 'grip', 'even', 'less', 'useful', 'one', 'handle', 'need', 'either', 'probably', 'cause', 'slip', 'another', 'feature', 'lock', 'find', 'wish', 'knife', 'variety', 'without', 'leave', 'also', 'rope', 'handle', 'try', 'feature', 'see', 'mean', 'item', 'true', 'perhaps', 'wrong', 'though', 'use', 'feature', 'wanted', 'like', 'lightweight', 'long', 'blade', 'well', 'find', 'instead', 'paid', 'cost', 'christmas', 'supposed', 'gift', 'even', 'cost', 'think', 'going', 'back', 'whole', 'product', 'come', 'across', 'barely', 'better', 'every', 'use', 'even', 'make', 'better', 'carry', 'knife', 'line', 'opinion', 'something', 'else', 'happy']"
37,3.0,"A simple piece of equipment, but the angle makes it uncomfortable.","The purpose of push up bars are to give you a full range of motion throughout your exercise.  When doing a bench press, you can bring the bar all the way down to your chest, which is a good range of motion.  Doing a regular push up on the floor, it's not as easy to get that range.

Was able to easily trim the housing and cable to the length I needed and installed in a flash.  Perhaps it's because the housing length is so short that I'm stressing how flexible the turn to the brake from the lever is but after a few years (granted, years of use) the housing has cracked a bit and no longer seats in the end caps.

I had to try several places before I could get it to lift. Then I noticed the actual sticker was somewhat flimsy. I was unable to get it in a straight line on the wall. The backing kept pulling everything down. When I revealed more of the sticker it immediately adhered to itself causing creases and ripples. Once I finally got it on the wall and noticed that it was crooked i tried to lift it up to reposition the word. It does come cleanly off the wall but in two small, fingernail sized, spots its impossible to unstick from itself. It's on the wall, I've gone over it repeatedly with a credit card to try and get the creases and air bubbles out. The two mountain stickers went up much easier.

50,3.0,Nice bottle but I got some odd color that is not even an option to order,"This is would have been a nice water bottle. SadIy I didn’t get what is depicted in the picture.

It is a 64oz water bottle and it does have the inspirational quotes on the side so that is good at least. But it is this dreary gray color instead and strangely not really a color option that seems to be available so not sure what I really got to be honest. It still holds water though and it should keep you nicely hydrated every day, if you can empty this every day.<br /><br />It has a wide opening which allows you to quickly fill it as well as add ice to it if you choose to. It has a flip top that has a secure lock so you can protect the opening you are drinking from, from dust, dirt, germs or whatever else really. You can use the straw it comes with or just remove it, totally up to you, personally I prefer to use it without it. It has a nice carrying handle that makes it easy to lug it along with you.<br /><br />It is BPA and toxin free which is important since you don't want to add toxins to your body slowly but surely through your water, trust me you will add it plenty of other ways, you don't have to add this one.

The bottle has what I'm assuming is Chinese writing on it so obviously I could not make it out what it says but I'm pretty sure it's green tea. The bottle was nearly empty with only about a half an inch of liquid left on the bottom. Upon further inspection I see that the package came all the way from China.

55,3.0,Headlamp doesn’t work; lantern works nicely but both lights can’t be on simultaneously – 2.5*,"In the box is a lantern with three AA batteries installed, a headlamp with two CR2032 batteries installed, and an instruction sheet. Note that the instruction sheet says that the AA batteries are not included but in mine they were included. I had to unscrew the compartment to remove tape holding the end batteries from connecting. A super tiny Philipps screwdriver is needed to get into either battery compartment.<br /><br />The lantern works. It has a nice handle and the on/off button cycles through just turning the eyes on or turning the bottom on as well as turning the unit off. Both top and bottom cannot be on at the same time. I would have liked this option, so that is a negative. However, the unit is cute.<br /><br />I had to throw out the headlamp. It would not turn on. I bought new batteries and it still didn't work. Then I tested the batteries that came with the unit in a bike light I have and the batteries worked. The headlamp is junk and that is disappointing. I tried for about 10 minutes to get this to work but could not.<br /><br />The current price of $16.99 ($19.99 minus $3) is competitively priced for this especially if it comes with both sets of batteries. I am unsure if that is the case for others or if the batteries were included by mistake for the lantern or not. Also, I do not know what the ""flash eyes"" comment means on the Amazon site. The eyes DO NOT flash, if that is what it means. Since I had to throw out the headlamp, I do not have confidence in this set. Also, I wish the lantern had the ability to fully light up.

96,3.0,Peace of Mind,"I have a 17 year old daughter and was thinking of her when I ordered these. First of all, it says there are 5 tests in the package, but there are actually 10. There are two tests per sheet and 5 sheets included. The paper tests are in a matchbook style folder. I think it would be great if that was then inside a vinyl holder or something to keep it from getting torn or dirty while being stored inside your purse. It says to make sure you read all the directions before administering a test. I found the directions to be extremely difficult to read because they are so tiny! I am not the target audience, so I guess that's okay. It's pretty easy to use. You put a drop of water on each of the test spots and then wait for it to dry which takes a few minutes. It's not a particularly discreet procedure. If you were on a blind date and took this out to test your drink, you can't easily hide your actions. I tested this using plain tap water. The directions say that the water will cause a light blue mark, which is normal.  Mine did just that. You're suppose to tear out the test sheet before testing the drink. But if you only use one test, you still have an unused test on the other half of the sheet, but there's really no place to put it securely.  I was not able to test it with anything that would cause it to have a positive reading, so I can only assume that it will work as indicated. I definitely think it's a good thing to have on hand when you have doubts.",1,"['year', 'old', 'daughter', 'thinking', 'ordered', 'first', 'say', 'test', 'package', 'actually', 'two', 'test', 'per', 'sheet', 'sheet', 'included', 'test', 'style', 'think', 'great', 'inside', 'holder', 'something', 'keep', 'getting', 'inside', 'say', 'make', 'sure', 'read', 'direction', 'test', 'found', 'direction', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'read', 'tiny', 'guess', 'okay', 'pretty', 'easy', 'use', 'put', 'drop', 'water', 'test', 'spot', 'wait', 'dry', 'take', 'minute', 'took', 'test', 'drink', 'easily', 'using', 'water', 'direction', 'say', 'water', 'cause', 'light', 'blue', 'mark', 'normal', 'mine', 'test', 'sheet', 'drink', 'use', 'one', 'test', 'still', 'test', 'half', 'sheet', 'really', 'place', 'put', 'securely', 'able', 'test', 'anything', 'cause', 'reading', 'work', 'definitely', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'hand']"

99,4.0,A+ for light and customer service; F- for instructions,"After Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast and I was without power for 9 days, I decided to purchase one more light to add to my army of 13 flashlights.  I wanted something that would illuminate a room better than my underwater flashlight and my headlamp. My underwater flashlight and head lamp happen to be exceptional lights but they can only be used for focused tasks since they lack a wide range.  This lantern not only gives exceptional light but it also illuminates an entire small room.<br /><br />These are the many features I like:<br /><br />- The lantern is so bright it is blinding but it definitely lights up my kitchen from 1/2 a room away.  I just had to make sure I did not look the light in the eye.<br />- It has a high and low mode.<br />- It can also be used as a strobe light (meaning in blinking mode).<br />- It only takes only 3 D size batteries (only one more battery than most D-battery flashlights).<br />- It's water resistant.<br />- It comes with a lifetime warranty.<br />- The lantern has a tent hook on the bottom; although it is a bit difficult to move.<br />- It also has an EZ-find light that blinks every few seconds; although that ""find"" light (which sits above the black power button) is barely visible in the dark.<br />- Customer service is excellent.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this light is that it did not come with any instructions; it only comes with a wrap-around paper touting its virtues.  Therefore, I had to call the company on the 800 I found on the Internet (you can find that # in my comments) to learn how to make the strobe light work.  I also asked how the EZ find light worked because I was unable to detect it.<br /><br />The tent hook and handle are self-explanatory but to make this light work, this is what I had to do.  Please note I executed all these instructions with the front of the lantern facing me:<br /><br />1. Both the top and bottom of the lantern screw off. The top is where the blub is and that can be screwed off counter-clockwise but there's really no reason to remove the top. I screwed off the bottom clockwise and inserted the 3 D batteries as indicated on the stickers inside.  I then lined up the red arrows (both on lid and case) when closing the bottom in the opposite direction I opened it and made I heard it click shut.<br /><br />2. I pushed the black button to operate the light.  Pressing it once brought on high mode and pressing it again brought on low mode. Sometimes I found that after one press no light comes on; in that case I pressed it again until I was in the desired mode. The tech said this was normal behavior.<br /><br />3. To get the strobe light working, I had to HOLD down the black button for about 5 or 6 seconds until the light started to flash. I then pressed the black button to turn the strobe effect off.<br /><br />4. To see the EZ find light that is located above the black on off button, I moved the lantern to a totally dark room.  This light flashed every 5 or 6 seconds but I still found it hard to see.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great lantern for illuminating a small room or anywhere I need to illuminate a larger area than a flashlight can provide. The light given off seems fluorescent but it's bright enough to work with.  The only thing I did not like is that instructions on how to operate the strobe, insert the batteries, etc. were not provided. Although I was able to figure out how to do most of this, I had no clue I had to HOLD down the on/off button for 5 or 6 seconds to get the strobe feature to work. Since this lantern is going into storage until I need it, I will take out the batteries as the EZ find light will probably drain them after a couple of months.",0,"['hit', 'without', 'power', 'day', 'decided', 'purchase', 'one', 'light', 'add', 'flashlight', 'wanted', 'something', 'room', 'better', 'flashlight', 'flashlight', 'head', 'light', 'used', 'since', 'lack', 'wide', 'range', 'lantern', 'give', 'light', 'also', 'entire', 'small', 'room', 'many', 'feature', 'like', 'lantern', 'bright', 'definitely', 'light', 'room', 'away', 'make', 'sure', 'look', 'light', 'eye', 'high', 'low', 'mode', 'also', 'used', 'light', 'mode', 'take', 'size', 'battery', 'one', 'battery', 'battery', 'flashlight', 'water', 'resistant', 'come', 'lantern', 'tent', 'hook', 'bottom', 'although', 'bit', 'difficult', 'move', 'also', 'find', 'light', 'every', 'second', 'although', 'find', 'light', 'black', 'power', 'button', 'barely', 'dark', 'customer', 'service', 'excellent', 'problem', 'light', 'come', 'instruction', 'come', 'wrap', 'around', 'company', 'found', 'find', 'make', 'light', 'work', 'also', 'find', 'light', 'worked', 'tent', 'hook', 'handle', 'make', 'light', 'work', 'please', 'note', 'instruction', 'front', 'lantern', 'top', 'bottom', 'lantern', 'screw', 'top', 'really', 'reason', 'remove', 'top', 'bottom', 'battery', 'inside', 'red', 'lid', 'case', 'bottom', 'direction', 'opened', 'made', 'black', 'button', 'light', 'high', 'mode', 'low', 'mode', 'sometimes', 'found', 'one', 'press', 'light', 'come', 'case', 'mode', 'said', 'normal', 'get', 'light', 'working', 'hold', 'black', 'button', 'second', 'light', 'started', 'black', 'button', 'turn', 'see', 'find', 'light', 'black', 'button', 'lantern', 'totally', 'dark', 'room', 'light', 'every', 'second', 'still', 'found', 'hard', 'see', 'great', 'lantern', 'small', 'room', 'anywhere', 'need', 'larger', 'area', 'flashlight', 'provide', 'light', 'given', 'seems', 'bright', 'enough', 'work', 'thing', 'like', 'instruction', 'insert', 'battery', 'etc', 'provided', 'although', 'able', 'figure', 'hold', 'button', 'second', 'get', 'feature', 'work', 'since', 'lantern', 'going', 'storage', 'need', 'take', 'battery', 'find', 'light', 'probably', 'couple', 'month']"

101,5.0,"Large, bright and convenient","As I write this review the sample that I received is magnetically attached to my refrigerator to serve as a late night kitchen light. I am not going to repeat the product specs, but at the time of this review the dimensions are not provided. Since this is a relatively large light I think that including the is important.<br /><br />The light is 8 inches long, of which 6.5 inches are unobstructed for displaying the light itself. The width is approximately 1.25 inches. Note also that the shape of this light is hexagonal, and three of the eight sides are part of the illuminating system. That means that this can be used directionally without blinding you in the process. If that sounds silly, I own a round LED light that is 360 degrees of illumination and it can be a chore to use in the dark of night. I have wrecked my night vision with that one more than once, but the design of this one prevents that.<br /><br />The product specs claim that the four steady settings range from two percent to one hundred percent of the 200 lumens. I personally think the two percent figure is off because even at that low setting this light will illuminate up to a meter (or even more) in front of you, and at full setting it will easily illuminate detail at five meters. I like the flashing setting too because this can be used as an emergency beacon as well as in home lighting.<br /><br />I have not tested this for a rundown, nor have I tested the recharging time. I did use it for two straight hours on full setting and it only slightly dimmed. If you combine it with a 2000mAh backup battery it makes a great emergency light.<br /><br />One final note: the magnets in the body are pretty strong. I tried knocking mine off my refrigerator door by purposely bumping into it and it budged, but held fast. I like this one so much that I am ordering a few more. The reason is I prefer rechargeable lights to replaceable battery ones. Plus, if I do need to check something in the yard at night (or make an emergency egress) this light is handily located on my fridge door. A few more would increase both safety and convenience.",0,"['review', 'received', 'attached', 'night', 'light', 'going', 'product', 'time', 'review', 'provided', 'since', 'large', 'light', 'think', 'including', 'important', 'light', 'inch', 'long', 'inch', 'light', 'inch', 'note', 'also', 'shape', 'light', 'three', 'side', 'part', 'system', 'mean', 'used', 'without', 'sound', 'round', 'light', 'degree', 'use', 'dark', 'night', 'night', 'one', 'design', 'one', 'product', 'four', 'setting', 'range', 'two', 'one', 'personally', 'think', 'two', 'figure', 'even', 'low', 'setting', 'light', 'even', 'front', 'full', 'setting', 'easily', 'five', 'like', 'setting', 'used', 'emergency', 'well', 'home', 'time', 'use', 'two', 'straight', 'hour', 'full', 'setting', 'slightly', 'battery', 'make', 'great', 'emergency', 'light', 'one', 'note', 'body', 'pretty', 'strong', 'tried', 'mine', 'door', 'held', 'fast', 'like', 'one', 'much', 'reason', 'prefer', 'light', 'battery', 'one', 'plus', 'need', 'check', 'something', 'yard', 'night', 'make', 'emergency', 'light', 'door', 'safety']"
102,5.0,Great for its intended uses.,"Our family of four used this product on our annual 2 week sojourn into a scattered site primitive camp setting.  To avoid filling the RV holding tank (requires repeated trips to civilization for a dump station) we used a portable toilet which can be emptied every few days at a  nearby national forest vault toilet.  The privacy tent was used for the toilet in lieu of draping tarps from surrounding trees.  The product was well made with good seams, adequate zippers and durable material and it  easily tolerated numerous daily uses.  It was exceptionally room for changing or simply moving about.  Staking the unit is recommended because its light and easily blown over if windy.  However staking would be difficult to do if setting this up for use on a hard surface.  For shower use plan for drainage and I suggest bringing a 1 inch shower pedestal.  Who wants to stand in mud when they shower.  If used for showering and toileting I recommend two tents.  One for each purpose.  For us the interior storage pouches were handy for sanitizers, paper products etc.  First time assembly was not as easy as pictured because the frame and tent were packed separately.  Take town and second time assembly were a snap: operating as pictured.  All in all, it's a good product that worked very well for us.

The quality and performance far exceeds my previous experiences.<br /><br />Each of these paddles have been designed for a specific purpose which include speed, spin and control. Now not being a professional, I can not “honestly” say that I notice the difference between any of these five different paddles, in any of the different design aspects while using them. However, I can honestly say that visually I can tell the difference by the different rubber padding (sandwiched between the inner and outer rubber) used in each. Some have a slightly different thickness, weight, color and I assume different “springiness”. With that said, each and every one of them have performed absolutely stellar in every way for my, and my family’s play style. Personally they all have incredible spin, speed and control capabilities. They are all built with beautiful build quality, and designed with comfort and balance in mind. I especially love the resin looking inlaid logo at the end of the handles. I realise that it doesn’t make a performance difference but it just ads to the overall beauty and gives each paddle a quality looking finish.<br /><br />Overall I feel quite privileged to have had the opportunity to use and experience the Joola brand and share my opinions, though I feel absolutely unqualified to have done so. Just know that if you have never used or played with a “quality” Ping Pong paddle, you are truly missing out, and this Joola brand will be the only brand I choose from here on out!

It's IWB and OWB combined that can work for right or left-handed draw.  It'll fit in most locations (back, hip, front) and fits an impressive array of guns.  It seemed to work well with a Bersa Thunder CC .380, SW 437 .38 (J-frame snubbie), Kel-Tec P-11, Springfield XDE (9mm) and Sig P-226 (9mm).  It feels better with the larger guns, I think, as the holster is then smaller in total carry volume.  With .380's, the holster feels as hefty as the weapon.

118,4.0,Great for kids!,"Ok, let's get something straight- there's no way 3-4 adults are fitting in this thing. But that's normal for tent ratings- they are usually a little bit generous with their occupancy rating and assume bodies are stacked like sardines inside. But this is more like half capacity at best- I'd say maybe 2 adults, or one adult and 2 kids. However, that did NOT stop 3 of my kids from wanting to run inside the very second it popped open. They fit comfortably inside and honestly it makes a great kid's tent if you want, for example, to have a separate adults' tent or even just let the kids have a backyard sleepover. We haven't used it in the rain yet so I can't vouch for that sort of use, but I CAN say that it pops open effortlessly by just removing it from the bag it comes in. Easiest tent install ever! Putting it back in? That's a challenge.<br />I like that it comes with directions sewn into the bag, but they were still hard to follow if you haven't done a tent fold like this before. It is similar to those car windshield pop up protectors in that it has plastic circular hoops that need to fold along itself to make a large oval into smaller circles. And if you make a mistake, it will POP open in your face and make you start over. That was annoying. But I did eventually get it to the correct size folding on the third try, and was able to get it back in the back and zip it up.<br />At $70, you can get a much bigger tent from Coleman or Ozark Trail, but not a pop up kind like this one. The instant pop ups fetch a premium, and I recall the last one I saw was slightly bigger than this one but nearly 2x the price, so I think it is priced appropriately for what it is. I'd consider this one a good value, I just wish it was easier to put away, and was a little more realistic about capacity.",0,"['let', 'get', 'something', 'straight', 'way', 'adult', 'thing', 'normal', 'tent', 'rating', 'usually', 'little', 'bit', 'rating', 'body', 'like', 'inside', 'like', 'half', 'best', 'say', 'maybe', 'adult', 'one', 'adult', 'kid', 'however', 'stop', 'kid', 'run', 'inside', 'second', 'open', 'fit', 'comfortably', 'inside', 'honestly', 'make', 'great', 'kid', 'tent', 'want', 'adult', 'tent', 'even', 'let', 'kid', 'used', 'rain', 'yet', 'sort', 'use', 'say', 'pop', 'open', 'bag', 'come', 'tent', 'install', 'ever', 'putting', 'back', 'like', 'come', 'direction', 'bag', 'still', 'hard', 'done', 'tent', 'fold', 'like', 'similar', 'car', 'pop', 'plastic', 'hoop', 'need', 'fold', 'along', 'make', 'large', 'smaller', 'make', 'pop', 'open', 'face', 'make', 'start', 'annoying', 'get', 'correct', 'size', 'folding', 'try', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'back', 'zip', 'get', 'much', 'bigger', 'tent', 'trail', 'pop', 'kind', 'like', 'one', 'pop', 'last', 'one', 'saw', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'one', 'price', 'think', 'priced', 'consider', 'one', 'good', 'value', 'wish', 'easier', 'put', 'away', 'little']"

I got this light for our 14 year old family geek. He spends hours at his desk every day doing homework and working on his various projects. A battery run lamp simply can't keep up with his lighting needs, not in any cost effective way. We did check this ""lamp"" in a darkened house and outdoors at night. It turns out to be much better as a flashlight than as a desk lamp. The pistol grip in it's supporting stand and it's light weight works well for that. It's light is bright and is more than adequate for making one's way on a dark night.

So I stood there with the hose nozzle aiming a jet inside and getting sprayed occasionally to fill it to the ‘best’ line. I followed the instructions on the box, started trying to inflate it with the foot pump, and on the third pump the pump started leaking water out all over the ground. Thankfully, I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that I should switch the ends of the hose connecting the foot to the shower bag. After I did that, it did work. However, the pressure is just not what I had hoped for. Nowhere near what I get from the garden sprayer.  The instructions need to be clearer.

166,5.0,FIVE WEEKS AND COUNTING- And Some Important Tips To Help Keep Things Sturdy.  This Is My Happy Place,"(WARNING- This is a long review.  I am covering areas about this tent that were a concern to me.  If you want a summary, go to the paragraph titled THE BOTTOM LINE)<br /><br />I wanted to take the time to review this tent.  I spent a LOT of hours researching, watching EVERY video and reading every available review I could find out there about this tent to decide which I would get.  It was between this tent and [[ASIN:B001TSCF96 Coleman Montana 8-Person Tent]].  As it turned out, we had an immediate need for TWO tents, so I got both of them.  You can see my review of the [[ASIN:B001TSCF96 Coleman Montana 8-Person Tent]] by clicking the link<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TENT LIKE?<br />One of the things I was concerned about was the thinness of material.  We live in a very high elevation and get constant breezes or wind.  There were a number of reviews that spoke of their tents snapping or ripping after only a gentle breeze.  The fabric is thin, yes.  But it does hold up.<br /><br />Enough people have posted photos, so I won't post one as of yet.  The best way to secure this tent is to ALWAYS leave the fly on.  An unexpected storm or wind can come up at any time, and I personally feel that the tent is much more stable with the fly on than without.  Make sure that you always stake down everything, including ALL of the ropes.  That is what keeps the tent stable and secure.<br /><br />FLOOR<br />The floor is very nice, and if you use a tarp underneath and take off shoes before entering, it will last quite a while.  I also recommend not using chairs with small pointed feet on it either- it will wear out the floor quickly.<br /><br />WINDOWS<br />The windows are perfect.  They are protected from all but the most severe of rainstorms so you can leave them open if you like.  The back window is open at all times, yes, but if staked down, it is not that big of a deal.  If we plan to take this on crowded camp sites, I will sew two rings at either back seam and attach a thin fabric when changing.  No big deal.<br /><br />POCKETS AND LANTERN RING<br />The pockets are nice and in a good space.  There is also a ring for hanging a lantern on if you like.<br /><br />HEIGHT<br />The height is perfect for us- the tallest is 5 ft 9 inches.  Taller people might not like this tent.  The screened in porch is a bit narrow for those with long legs. You pretty much need a chair to use it unless you are a kid and don't need to lean back.<br /><br />SCREENED IN PORCH<br />I LOVE this thing.  I really do.  This is my happy place.  It is perfect for two camp chairs to look out at night or in the day.  The door of the tent can stay open adding to a spacious feel.  It does get wet in the rain.  I am currently designing a fly to go over the porch and roll up into the tent when not in use.  So far I am almost done with the one half of the fly and plan to finish the other half this week if I can.  I hope to do that before the tent is taken down.<br /><br />Without a fly, your stuff will get wet.  There is an area that you can sweep the water into when wet, I use a sponge mop to clean it up so it will dry faster.  Otherwise it puddles and does take a long time to dry.<br /><br />POLES<br />The poles went up well for us, but you just have to take your time when putting up the tent.  Do not race through the process, the fabric can rip if you don't.<br /><br />TENT SPACE<br />Our biggest concern was ACTUAL usable space for us.  We found that putting a queen inflatable double height mattress in there (Coleman) we have plenty of room for two of us.  If using an additional single mattress, we can still do it, but it works best with a sleeping bag on the floor and picked up at night if a third person is in there (child).<br /><br />When using or covering up the porch in rain, the porch makes a great extension for activities, talking, or just sitting and enjoying the view (if not raining).  I absolutely love the design of this tent.<br /><br />LIGHTING<br />The tent color is half of the beauty of this tent.  The light bright colors are cheerful, let in a lot of light, and also keep it from feeling gloomy on rainy days.  At night you can see through it, so keep that in mind when you are getting ready at night.<br /><br />DOES THIS STAY UP IN STORMS?<br />The big question.  I have an answer for you.  We purchased this tent the week before Labor Day (US).  We put the tent up immediately and treated it with silicone spray.  We didn't need to- it is already made from silicone impregnated ripstop nylon.  The seams also came pre-treated with silicone on the fly.  AMAZING!.<br /><br />We have had this tent up with daily use since then and it is now October 8,2016.  So far it has been through extreme heat, breezes, high winds, thunder storms, all night rains, and heavy rain storms.  The tent has stayed up with no observable damage at this point and stayed very dry too.<br /><br />IMPORTANT POINTS<br />After reading MANY reviews on this tent, I decided to help it stay up, I would reinforce different areas.  Anywhere that there is a plastic hook, I put a piece of garden twist tie into the fabric loop that holds the hook and tied it around the pole to help it absorb any shock of high winds.  Any other plastic rings or hooks were reinforced in the same way.  I tucked the ends of the twist tie way under so no chance of the fabric blowing into sharp edges and tearing in high winds.<br /><br />STAKES<br />I also recommend getting other stakes for the tent.  They stay in the ground during storms more easily too.  I got [[ASIN:B01IEBKK92 Pack of 16, 7075 Aluminum Outdoors Tent Stakes & Rubber Hammer & Guyline Tensioner with Reflective Pull Cords & Carrying Pouch]] to use in the fly staking process, and used the ones that came with the tent for the actual tent staked to the ground.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Honestly, this is my favorite tent of all time.  It is my happy place.  I absolutely LOVE the design, set up, colors, and ventilation of this tent.  With a mattress, it is still private to lay down with the windows open and you can still look out at the sky and enjoy the scenery.  When you are in the tent and want to have breeze, the front door open makes it seem so airy and wonderful.  I can not rave about this tent enough.  Five weeks of constant use is more than we planned for, but it has held up so far.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED at five stars.<br /><br />QUESTIONS AND UPDATES<br />If you have any questions I have not answered, by all means ask.  I hope I can be helpful, as I know how it helps me when others do the same.  I will update with any more input should I have anything else to share or if there are problems with the tent.",0,"['long', 'review', 'area', 'tent', 'concern', 'want', 'bottom', 'line', 'wanted', 'take', 'time', 'review', 'tent', 'spent', 'lot', 'hour', 'watching', 'every', 'video', 'reading', 'every', 'available', 'review', 'find', 'tent', 'get', 'tent', 'asin', 'person', 'tent', 'turned', 'need', 'two', 'tent', 'got', 'see', 'review', 'asin', 'person', 'tent', 'tent', 'like', 'one', 'thing', 'material', 'live', 'high', 'get', 'wind', 'number', 'review', 'tent', 'fabric', 'thin', 'yes', 'doe', 'hold', 'enough', 'people', 'photo', 'post', 'one', 'yet', 'best', 'way', 'secure', 'tent', 'always', 'leave', 'fly', 'wind', 'come', 'time', 'personally', 'feel', 'tent', 'much', 'fly', 'without', 'make', 'sure', 'always', 'stake', 'everything', 'including', 'rope', 'keep', 'tent', 'secure', 'floor', 'floor', 'nice', 'use', 'underneath', 'take', 'shoe', 'last', 'quite', 'also', 'recommend', 'using', 'chair', 'small', 'foot', 'either', 'wear', 'floor', 'quickly', 'window', 'window', 'perfect', 'leave', 'open', 'like', 'back', 'window', 'open', 'time', 'yes', 'big', 'deal', 'plan', 'take', 'camp', 'two', 'ring', 'either', 'back', 'seam', 'attach', 'thin', 'fabric', 'big', 'deal', 'pocket', 'lantern', 'ring', 'pocket', 'nice', 'good', 'space', 'also', 'ring', 'lantern', 'like', 'height', 'height', 'perfect', 'inch', 'people', 'might', 'like', 'tent', 'bit', 'long', 'leg', 'pretty', 'much', 'need', 'chair', 'use', 'unless', 'kid', 'need', 'back', 'love', 'thing', 'really', 'happy', 'place', 'perfect', 'two', 'camp', 'chair', 'look', 'night', 'day', 'door', 'tent', 'stay', 'open', 'feel', 'doe', 'get', 'wet', 'rain', 'fly', 'roll', 'tent', 'use', 'far', 'almost', 'done', 'one', 'half', 'fly', 'plan', 'half', 'week', 'hope', 'tent', 'taken', 'without', 'fly', 'stuff', 'get', 'wet', 'area', 'water', 'wet', 'use', 'clean', 'dry', 'otherwise', 'doe', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'dry', 'pole', 'pole', 'went', 'well', 'take', 'time', 'putting', 'tent', 'fabric', 'tent', 'space', 'concern', 'actual', 'space', 'found', 'putting', 'double', 'height', 'mattress', 'plenty', 'room', 'two', 'using', 'additional', 'single', 'mattress', 'still', 'work', 'best', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'floor', 'night', 'person', 'child', 'using', 'rain', 'make', 'great', 'activity', 'sitting', 'absolutely', 'love', 'design', 'tent', 'tent', 'color', 'half', 'tent', 'light', 'bright', 'color', 'let', 'lot', 'light', 'also', 'keep', 'feeling', 'day', 'night', 'see', 'keep', 'mind', 'getting', 'ready', 'night', 'doe', 'stay', 'big', 'purchased', 'tent', 'week', 'day', 'put', 'tent', 'immediately', 'silicone', 'need', 'already', 'made', 'silicone', 'seam', 'also', 'came', 'silicone', 'fly', 'amazing', 'tent', 'daily', 'use', 'since', 'far', 'heat', 'high', 'wind', 'night', 'rain', 'heavy', 'rain', 'tent', 'point', 'dry', 'important', 'point', 'reading', 'many', 'review', 'tent', 'decided', 'help', 'stay', 'different', 'area', 'anywhere', 'plastic', 'hook', 'put', 'piece', 'twist', 'tie', 'fabric', 'loop', 'hold', 'hook', 'around', 'pole', 'help', 'high', 'wind', 'plastic', 'ring', 'hook', 'way', 'end', 'twist', 'tie', 'way', 'chance', 'fabric', 'sharp', 'edge', 'high', 'wind', 'stake', 'also', 'recommend', 'getting', 'stake', 'tent', 'stay', 'ground', 'easily', 'got', 'asin', 'pack', 'tent', 'stake', 'rubber', 'pull', 'cord', 'carrying', 'pouch', 'use', 'fly', 'used', 'one', 'came', 'tent', 'actual', 'tent', 'ground', 'bottom', 'line', 'honestly', 'favorite', 'tent', 'time', 'happy', 'place', 'absolutely', 'love', 'design', 'set', 'color', 'tent', 'mattress', 'still', 'lay', 'window', 'open', 'still', 'look', 'enjoy', 'tent', 'want', 'front', 'door', 'open', 'make', 'seem', 'wonderful', 'tent', 'enough', 'five', 'week', 'use', 'held', 'far', 'highly', 'recommended', 'five', 'star', 'update', 'mean', 'hope', 'helpful', 'know', 'help', 'others', 'update', 'anything', 'else', 'problem', 'tent']"

184,3.0,fitbit 3,"Well.  I have been using this for many months.  I waited to be provide a fair and honest assessment. This is a review of my personal experience.  My main disappointment is the syncing with the fitbit app - I have a samsung android smart phone with the app installed, further - the app is current with all provided updates. The fitbit 3 itself needs to be ""restarted"" multiple times a week- you must attach it to the charging cable, push/hold the side button and hold for up to 10 seconds to force restart.  Otherwise it does NOT sync.  SUPER annoying.  And then there are the times when it randomly decides NOT to record my sleep record.  GRRRR....  I have had multiple fitbits - beginning with their gen one version.  Provides reasonably accurate info - BUT if you must FIGHT to get the info through sync - it sort of looses it appeal.  While it says that it does allow you to swim, so water friendly, I do not soak or submerge the fitbit.  I don't remove it as I wash dishes or my hands - so it has been splashed with water.  When I get in the pool, I take it off.  I just don't trust the water friendly part.  I may go back to my fitbit 2 because it is so much more slim and attractive.  These are somewhat clunky.  I also have tried the much larger watch face version - I quickly stopped using it as it is horribly uncomfortable in size alone - the fitbit 3 is much better than that watch face/square version.  The bands on the fitbit 3 are easy to change.  I have not placed a screen/face protection shields on and haven't had too much trouble with scratching - in fact I don't see any - yet.  So I can't say how easy it is to replace the face - or to place the protection screening on.  I wear my fitbit on one wrist during the day and change it to the other wrist at night while sleeping - I use an alcohol wipe to clean the back of the unit and band several times a week. Further I don't wear it one or two nights a week to give my skin a break and to charge it.  I did purchase the perforated (holes in the band) to provide more breathability.  It is a workable step monitor.  I just wish it would sync more reliably and without forcing a restart which you can't just do where ever you are - but must be done while attached to the charging cord.

188,4.0,Functional,"Purchased for: 2012 Ram 1500 Laramie CC<br /><br />First off, the visor organizer I received looks nothing like the one pictured above.

This is the reason I removed one star, since I didn't receive the item as pictured and that I had thought I would then be receiving.<br /><br />Not much to say, it's an organizer. Zippers work, velcro closure on the side leaning flap works. This attaches to the sun visor with four straps that wrap around the front and back of the visor and attach to themselves with velcro. For right now, they are holding. But on my truck, these straps are just long enough to wrap and overlap each other to ensure a good grip on the visor. I assume they will continue to hold since I do not plan on loading the organizer with too many items or papers (just my registration, insurance card and a pen for now) but I could see this not holding long if I were to add anything of considerable weight.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the organizer since it is very nice having a dedicated place to store my reg and ins close at hand (in my truck the glove box is a far reach from the driver's seat).

230,5.0,"excellent bottle, easy to chug from, doesnt leak, sturdy paracord handle, optional straw & hook","Big ole water bottle that holds 64 ounces (2 liters). Has sligh indent on two sides to help grasp it, also has a very sturdy paracord handle. Buy this for the sturdy attractive bottle to drink directly from and not necessarily for the straw. Nothing wrong with the product exactly, as I have seen this straw used in a variety of brands. It simply may or may not work well for you. I dont care for it, so I took it right out. Nice addition, but useless for me.<br /><br />The main aspects I like is the durable feel of the bottle, the robust color, the quality paracord handle, the snap tight lid, the wide opening (can stick hand in to clean with ease), good mouth spout-- very easy to draw from, locking cap, optional finger hook (hidden so well that it is easy to overlook. It pops up from top). And of course the times with motivational messages on one side, and the amount at each level on the other.<br /><br />I have filled my bottle, snapped it closed then took the chance on holding it upside down. It was risky behavior as I did this over my living room carpet rather than the kitchen sink. Thankfully the lid stayed firmly locked, and the seal is really good-- not a single drop escaped. Phew! So while I dont see my bottle being in the position, it is nice to know that I can toss it in a bag and not worry so much about it opening up too easily, if at all.<br /><br />I like this bottle a lot. I wanted to down rate based on the straw, then I decided that the dislike for the straw is more of a preference thing. This is not a ""built in straw"" type bottle. It just includes a flexible straw that if all goes well it pretty much stays in position when the cap is closed. Odd but it works.<br /><br />Been using this the better part of a week, I have loads of bottles and keep them in a few different spots in the house rather than carry just one around. I am open to using a large bottle for use in the spot i hang out the most. I reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy like the drinking port as I can easily sip or chug- making it easier and quicker to get my water in.",0,"['big', 'water', 'bottle', 'hold', 'two', 'side', 'help', 'also', 'sturdy', 'handle', 'buy', 'sturdy', 'bottle', 'drink', 'straw', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'product', 'exactly', 'seen', 'straw', 'used', 'variety', 'brand', 'simply', 'may', 'may', 'work', 'well', 'do', 'nt', 'care', 'took', 'right', 'nice', 'addition', 'useless', 'main', 'like', 'durable', 'feel', 'bottle', 'color', 'quality', 'handle', 'snap', 'tight', 'lid', 'wide', 'opening', 'stick', 'hand', 'clean', 'good', 'mouth', 'easy', 'cap', 'finger', 'hook', 'well', 'easy', 'pop', 'top', 'course', 'time', 'one', 'side', 'amount', 'level', 'filled', 'bottle', 'closed', 'took', 'chance', 'holding', 'room', 'rather', 'lid', 'seal', 'really', 'good', 'single', 'drop', 'do', 'nt', 'see', 'bottle', 'position', 'nice', 'know', 'bag', 'worry', 'much', 'opening', 'easily', 'like', 'bottle', 'lot', 'wanted', 'rate', 'based', 'straw', 'decided', 'straw', 'thing', 'built', 'straw', 'type', 'bottle', 'straw', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'stay', 'position', 'cap', 'closed', 'work', 'using', 'better', 'part', 'week', 'bottle', 'keep', 'different', 'spot', 'house', 'rather', 'carry', 'one', 'around', 'open', 'using', 'large', 'bottle', 'use', 'spot', 'hang', 'like', 'drinking', 'easily', 'making', 'easier', 'get', 'water']"
231,3.0,So Far So Good {Editied 10-06-2017},"If you want to get a fire going and you're using premade tinder or something homemade you're going to have to start small as the electrodes are rather close together. I was easily able to get small pieces of paper burning with little effort.<br />But to be honest? I burn a lot of Morning Star stick incense which fits perfectly between the electrodes of the TekFire. I got tired of grill/barbeque lighters with more safeties than some guns a few required two hands to operate or cheap lighters that even half full stop working after a few uses. I saw this rechargeable fuel-less lighter and have found i perfect for lighting my incense and tea lights as well as tall candles and oil lamps rather nicely. Durability is something we're going to have to see over time. The lighter comes with a two year warranty so there's plenty of time to give it a workout and see how it performs. So far? I'm very happy with this item.<br /><br />Edit 10-06-2017 - This is sold as survival/camping gear. I simply use it around the house to light small candles and stick incense which small are a fairly tight fit between the electrodes. If this is meant for outdoor use why would they put a cheap, fragile and easily broken clear plastic hinge on the unit? Mine, after less than a month is severely wobbly. I would have no faith this would survive long term camping trips. I take care of my gear, as an example my backpack (a Jansport Eiger) is well over 30 years old. My sheath knife is similarly aged and even has my name and Explorer Post number scratched into the back of the sheath. I can't imagine this lighter lasting two years let alone 30+. I'm ready for the hinge to break any day now.

277,5.0,Very Bright and Versatile Flashlight,"[[VIDEOID:97485467a42838457096fc5f5b521c7a]] I work in an area where a good, bright flashlight it often an absolute necessity. I like the brightness of the latest generation LED flashlights even though it can be harsh as they can really light up and area so much better than an incandescent light or cheaper LED lights. This is an exceptionally bright flashlight that works very well and is easy to adjust.<br /><br />In the package is the flashlight itself, a rechargeable 18650 battery and a battery charger. Everything you need to get going and using this light is in the box and the battery is charged up already so when you open the box you're ready to go. Also included is a holder/adapter for AAA batteries so this flashlight can be used with 3 AAA batteries instead of so desired.<br /><br />This flashlight has 5 operating modes: high brightness, medium brightness, low brightness, strobe and SOS. When the power button is pressed but not clicked all the way it changes the mode of the flashlight. Pressing it all the way in so it clicks turns the whole thing on and off.

As a bonus, it comes with a wrist lanyard.<br /><br />This is the flashlight I carry in my toolbag to work every day. I am very pleased with it and am happy to recommend it. It is exceedingly bright, it is very adjustable and it has multiple operating modes.

It was easy to carry but there was absolutely no instructions on picture on how to put together.  Took us about 20 mins in the hot heat with small kiddos waiting to get in the ocean.  It was Uber frustrating.  Also, this will not fit two chair as shown in pic.  Not a lot of sun protection unless you plan on laying down in the tent.  We were able to keep the cooler and sun beach bag out of the sun but that was it.  I am bummed I spent $40 on this.

287,1.0,"Great idea, but needs lots of improvement","I really wanted this to work. My 1.5 year old loves to sit on my bike seat and also loves her balance bike. I thought this bike seat and handlebar set would be perfect. Unfortunately there are some big issues, some are design flaws and others are compatibility issues with my bike.<br /><br />First, there are no instructions. The pictures on the box are good enough to get close, but some actual instructions would be nice. It took about 15 min to get set up. Second, the bracket isn’t wide enough to go around my bike’s top tube (a trek fuel ex 8) and have the quick release and foot pegs work. I had to bend the side brackets for it to fit. This may be related to the next issue, which is the seat slips after hitting a bump. Also, the seat wobbles and there is no way to tighten it. Last, the way it attaches is not very convenient or quick. The screws take a long time to adjust and tighten. Even the quick release has to screw in place.<br /><br />Edited to add:<br /><br />The instructions are on the small side of the outside of the box. The pictures are really small and there aren’t any words. But I was able to figure out how to widen the bracket to fit my bike. It is a lot more solid now and doesn’t slip as easily (but it still does sometimes).",1,"['really', 'wanted', 'work', 'year', 'old', 'love', 'sit', 'bike', 'seat', 'also', 'love', 'balance', 'bike', 'thought', 'bike', 'seat', 'handlebar', 'set', 'perfect', 'unfortunately', 'big', 'issue', 'design', 'flaw', 'others', 'issue', 'bike', 'first', 'instruction', 'picture', 'box', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'close', 'actual', 'instruction', 'nice', 'took', 'get', 'set', 'second', 'isn', 'wide', 'enough', 'around', 'bike', 'top', 'tube', 'quick', 'release', 'foot', 'work', 'side', 'fit', 'may', 'next', 'issue', 'seat', 'slip', 'also', 'seat', 'way', 'tighten', 'last', 'way', 'quick', 'screw', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'adjust', 'tighten', 'even', 'quick', 'release', 'screw', 'place', 'add', 'instruction', 'small', 'side', 'outside', 'box', 'picture', 'really', 'small', 'able', 'figure', 'fit', 'bike', 'lot', 'solid', 'doesn', 'slip', 'easily', 'still', 'doe', 'sometimes']"

289,4.0,Great lightweight backpack for simple items; it’s water resistant,"This backpack is a bit unexpected in its design. It folds into the interior pocket. Therefore, the pouch that it came in is actually the inside pocket of the central compartment. All I had to do was unzip the pouch and unfold the backpack from within that pouch. I then had to pull the pouch inside out so that it formed an interior zippered pocket and tuck the loop inside.<br /><br />I think that the design is really neat. I was able to fit a couple of pounds of mandarins inside along with my wallet and a few other incidentals. I walked around with this a little bit and found it to be comfortable as long as I cinched the shoulder straps tighter. There is no padding in the straps, so walking more than one mile would most likely get uncomfortable. The material reminds me of the baggalini-type bags made of a strong nylon. However, this backpack is thin, so I do feel anything with sharp edges would tear through this after prolonged use.  The material is water resistant. I actually put part of the pack under running water and the water just rolled right off.<br /><br />There are two mesh water bottle pockets on each side and they fit my standard-sized water bottles just fine. There is also an exterior outside pocket. The tiny reflective strips at the edges of the outside pocket are a nice safety touch; however, the strips they put on the top interior of the water bottle pockets are useless unless those pockets remain empty. Someone did not think out that design.<br /><br />Overall, for the current price of $15.99 plus 5% off with a coupon savings, I feel this is a very good deal. It packs small and light and is perfect to carry around for when an extra backpack is needed. This 20 (or 22L - depending on which part of the Amazon ad one reads) size is like a full-sized backpack without any cushioning.

294,3.0,Excellent But Expensive Single Custard Cup Made of Borosilicate Glass,"This 8-1/2 ounce MARINEX GLASS CUSTARD CUP is slightly larger than the small Pyrex custard cups that I've always used for baked custard.  However, it's still a very convenient size for single servings of custard, pudding, or ice cream.<br /><br />The Marinex brand is expensive, but superior to the present-day Pyrex brand, because Marinex glass cookware is made from borosilicate glass.  Borosilicate glass, which has a slight green tinge, is less susceptible to thermal shock than the tempered soda lime glass used by Pyrex.  (Years ago, Pyrex dishes were also made of borosilicate glass.)  I feel safer using glass cookware made with borosilicate glass, because some of my newer Pyrex dishes have shattered when they were removed from the oven and placed on a room-temperature, ceramic-tile countertop.  (Now I always place glass cookware on a hotpad or oven mitt.)<br /><br />When I ordered this item, I thought that the listing must be for four Marinex custard cups, because of the price (about $16).  In fact, I received just one custard cup, as the listing promises.  The single custard cup is a genuine Marinex custard cup, and it is identical to the ones in the four-cup set that I purchased from Amazon for about the same price (see [[ASIN:B008H07AQC Marinex Set of Four Glass Custard Cups, 8-1/2-Ounce]]).

Or, keep the extra for backup if lost or misplaced.<br /><br />Set also includes x2 larger jump rings made to attach to a keyring. **However, the handcuff key itself is missing any possible way to connect this ring- making jump ring use 100% obsolete. I mention to be sure no one makes same mistake I did- seeing included rings I felt safe to assume option was possible.. NoPe! Unfortunately, without this the set cannot meet our needs.<br /><br />Key itself is metal with a plastic cover/casing.. unsure if metal is a solid piece in length bc it’s covered- and so, I cant guarantee its strength. End point seems very robust and able to perform with merit. Tbh, our set will go into a drawer on a chance it proves useful in some slim scenario. But, without needed option- Im just not sure that will happen.<br /><br />Key is equipped with a “pen clip” that can be connected like that of a ballpoint pen to a pocket or something similar. Easy to lose or become loose- this method isn’t for me! But I mention for any who may prefer.<br /><br />Overall, key may be functional to do job its intended but it’s limited and a bit deceiving with extra rings included.

313,3.0,Still Not Sure,"Usually I don't review, but I'm extremely torn on this and don't want anyone else to get 'caught'. I love the hydration part of the pack and the size and shape of it. I've used Camelbak products for years and have always been very happy with them. This pack can carry a ton, it's lightweight and has chest and waist straps to keep it in place. It even expands if I need it to. The bladder is a bit difficult to fill since I don't want to bother taking it out and putting it back in but it's not impossible. I use it to snowshoe and to cross country ski in northern Wyoming where it's pretty cold and my water stays cool, and doesn't freeze (at least not yet). My problems with the pack -- there are no rings of any sort to hang an extra pair of gloves on (or anything else I might need to keep going). Also, and the most irksome feature is the shoulder strap adjustment is backwards - you have to pull up on the strap to tighten it and flip the clasp downward to loosen it. I carry other backpacks for other needs and they ALL always require a lift of the clasp to loosen the straps for easy on and off and a quick pull down on the strap to move the pack back into place. This one is extremely awkward and leaves the excess strap flopping around, unless you want to take the time to remove your gloves and mess around (and believe me at 10 degrees you do NOT want to) with the little piece of velcro that is supposed to wrap around the excess strap to hold it in place. So, if this wasn't so darn difficult to get into and out of I'd probably love it. Instead, I'm in search of a pack that's easier to work with. And BTW if Camelbak actually cares (and I wrote to them but never received a response) they could also add a bungee strap to the outside since it'd be nice to shed some layers sometimes and just stuff them onto the pack (instead of stopping, removing the pack, putting them inside and readjusting the stupid pack!). If you don't ever need to adjust your pack, I'd highly recommend it, but if you like easy on/easy off and don't always wear the same clothes (or even the same number of layers) I'd keep looking.",1,"['usually', 'review', 'extremely', 'want', 'anyone', 'else', 'get', 'love', 'part', 'pack', 'size', 'shape', 'used', 'product', 'year', 'always', 'happy', 'pack', 'carry', 'ton', 'lightweight', 'waist', 'strap', 'keep', 'place', 'even', 'need', 'bladder', 'bit', 'difficult', 'fill', 'since', 'want', 'taking', 'putting', 'back', 'use', 'pretty', 'cold', 'water', 'stay', 'cool', 'doe', 'least', 'yet', 'problem', 'pack', 'ring', 'sort', 'hang', 'extra', 'pair', 'glove', 'anything', 'else', 'might', 'need', 'keep', 'going', 'also', 'feature', 'shoulder', 'strap', 'adjustment', 'pull', 'strap', 'tighten', 'carry', 'backpack', 'need', 'always', 'lift', 'strap', 'easy', 'quick', 'pull', 'strap', 'move', 'pack', 'back', 'place', 'one', 'extremely', 'strap', 'around', 'unless', 'want', 'take', 'time', 'remove', 'glove', 'around', 'believe', 'degree', 'want', 'little', 'piece', 'velcro', 'supposed', 'wrap', 'around', 'strap', 'hold', 'place', 'difficult', 'get', 'probably', 'love', 'instead', 'pack', 'easier', 'work', 'actually', 'care', 'never', 'received', 'also', 'add', 'strap', 'outside', 'since', 'nice', 'sometimes', 'stuff', 'onto', 'pack', 'instead', 'pack', 'putting', 'inside', 'pack', 'ever', 'need', 'adjust', 'pack', 'highly', 'recommend', 'like', 'easy', 'easy', 'always', 'wear', 'even', 'number', 'keep', 'looking']"

332,3.0,"Doesn't just run big, it runs HUGE. Otherwise pretty good product.","Unfortunately I'll be returning this item as it's HUGELY oversized. I bought the horse size hoping it'd be fairly standard and could adjust up or down for use on a variety of types of horses, but I think it'd be roomy even on a draft. Obviously every brand is slightly different in sizing, but there's absolutely no way this could ever be called &#34;horse size&#34;, or even &#34;warmblood size&#34;. One of the main horses I'd hoped to use this on is an 18.1hh cyldesdale-cross who would happily fit into even most draft-sized tack, yet there was no way to make this work for him.  Even punching holes wouldn't have fixed the size issue, as it would have required the cheek buckles to sit ABOVE the brow-band. It's seriously HUGE.<br /><br />Three stars, because the quality is actually pretty good-- I'd have given 4 if it were just &#34;bigger than normal&#34; instead of &#34;pachyderm sized&#34; and absolutely unworkable. Anyone purchasing this should order a full two sizes below what they normally order-- pony size for a horse, possibly cob sized for a heavy warmblood. The leather and hardware quality is impressive and very acceptable for the price point. I really appreciated it has a jaw strap to keep the cheek pieces from being pulled into the eyes (as a lungeing cavesson should have) as opposed to a throatlash like you see on most cheapo cavessons. A throatlash can't be tight enough to prevent slipping AND loose enough to not restrict the windpipe.  My only gripe with the construction would be that because the brass nose-piece is so heavy (as it should be), the chinstrap needs to be adjusted quite firmly too keep it from being pulled around or slipping to the side-- however the chin strap isn't sufficiently padded for this, and really requires a channel pad to be safely tight enough while still being comfortable for the horse.",1,"['unfortunately', 'returning', 'item', 'bought', 'horse', 'size', 'hoping', 'fairly', 'standard', 'adjust', 'use', 'variety', 'type', 'horse', 'think', 'even', 'every', 'brand', 'slightly', 'different', 'sizing', 'absolutely', 'way', 'ever', 'horse', 'size', 'even', 'size', 'one', 'main', 'horse', 'use', 'fit', 'even', 'sized', 'yet', 'way', 'make', 'work', 'even', 'hole', 'fixed', 'size', 'issue', 'sit', 'band', 'huge', 'three', 'star', 'quality', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'given', 'bigger', 'normal', 'instead', 'sized', 'absolutely', 'anyone', 'order', 'full', 'two', 'size', 'normally', 'order', 'size', 'horse', 'sized', 'heavy', 'quality', 'price', 'point', 'really', 'strap', 'keep', 'piece', 'pulled', 'eye', 'like', 'see', 'tight', 'enough', 'loose', 'enough', 'construction', 'piece', 'heavy', 'need', 'quite', 'keep', 'pulled', 'around', 'side', 'however', 'strap', 'really', 'requires', 'pad', 'tight', 'enough', 'still', 'comfortable', 'horse']"

Mission Accomplished,"I was really looking for a way to kick start some healthier habits and this watch and the 10,000 steps program seemed to be a perfect match.  I'm a couple months in and I can say without a doubt that I am noticeably more in shape than I was when this watch came in the mail.<br /><br />As for the 10,000 steps program, you could not get easier.  If you haven't gotten your steps in, walk until you do. It is low impact but the results are tangiable for those of us who have spent too much time in our cubicles.<br /><br />The watch itself is pretty easy to use.  I had no problems setting the watch and the function buttons are pretty straightforward. The few problems I do have with it are that the strap is tight and tends to pinch and pull arm hairs.  Also on occasion it seems to miss steps unless you are actively swinging your arm. It seemed like I was swinging my arms in a little exaggerated motion for a while, but now it feels like I'm engaging my upper body while walking.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Absolutely simple entry to healthier activity<br />+ Encoraging to keep going to meet your goal<br />+ It tells time, right there on your arm, no need to pull your phone out.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Band is a little tight, or at the next step, a little loose.<br />- Not a Con, but I find I don't use the heart rate monitor<br />- Auto resets at midnight - I work second shift so that is not ideal so I set it to shift at noon.  Perhaps that can be changed.<br />- I misplaced it for a couple days and missed it.<br /><br />Summary<br />I'll be modest about what this watch has done for me.  I'm not going to South Beach based on the 10,000 steps.  But when I walk out my front door to go to work, I feel stronger legs.  I see definition as fat has been going down and muscles are firming up. It's not an instant cure, but I see it as, in six weeks I can look and feel better, the same or worse.

339,5.0,"Lightweight, Easy to Clean, Priced Well","I have a son who is involved in basketball and has been on teams of one form or another since he was very young. This year he is on a competitive team and he has not one but two coaches that direct the team. This basketball coach's clipboard is an excellent fit for his game and is a valuable accessory for his coaches when in the middle of a game.<br /><br />This is a solid, smooth plastic clipboard that has the diagram of the court on it. It is large enough to draw out complicate plays without being unwieldy and small enough to fit in a book bag. It is fairly lightweight and easy to hold in one hand while drawing with the other.<br /><br />I have worked with other coaching clipboards and have seen some that come with a magnetic metal surface. Plastic is preferable to be honest as it is lighter and it does not show scratches as easily. The downside it that plastic is more susceptible to breaking if dropped.<br /><br />As a dry erase surface, this is a fine board. I used a black dry erase marker on it and it cleaned up without any trouble at all. It did not seem to collect any residue either, though I have not had it long enough to know for sure if it will eventually stain, so it will take some time to know.<br /><br />One thing I wish came with this clipboard would be an actual dry erase marker. This is just the board, with no marker or eraser.<br /><br />If you are coaching basketball at any level you likely will need a coaching clipboard unless you like drawing on paper or are very detailed when you speak. As a coach's clipboard this is a good one – it is easy to clean, it's lightweight and it is relatively inexpensive.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

344,2.0,I'm sure there are better products out there for the money.,"OK, first of all - full disclosure. This came in five days after I had bilateral knee surgery to clean out arthritis in both knees. My husband told me to try it out on the kitchen tile floor. He was standing right there, thankfully.  I gently placed my butt on it and the damn thing slid out from under me! I did the Wiley coyote flailing around thing, and caught hold of my husband's shirt as he grabbed my arms and thankfully kept me from falling, but it wrenched my knees pretty bad. Let's just say  that the language coming out of my mouth was not suitable for children, probably not even for many adults.<br /><br />So my less than favorable review of this product may be slightly skewed by my experience. However in my opinion, this type of product should NOT slide on a tile floor.  In addition, it's rather bulky,  and not all that light. So calling it a lightweight portable seat isn't accurate in my opinion. It's fairly large to lug around.  And it's not comfortable to sit on.

Like biometric scales they can track your progress and help you get a handle on your health by reporting your information easily and allowing you to connect to your phone or tablet so you can map your progress. I had hoped to start working with the Razer Nabu X and start taking some readings but unfortunately it has not worked out so well.<br /><br />The platforms for which it is designed to interact are iOS and Android. I have a Windows phone so that rules out my phone, at least for now (this is my fault, not the Nabu X’s fault). In spite of not being supported, it pairs and connects with my phone without any problem at all. I tried with an Android device, a Sony Xperia Z, and while it paired it would not maintain the connection. As such I have a device that I cannot use.<br /><br />I looked for a compatibility list and found a short list of compatible devices in the QA section of Razer’s support website. The Xperia Z is listed among the supported devices so I am not sure what might be causing the problem. Either it is not exactly compatible as they claim or I received a faulty device. The fact that it connects OK with my Windows phone suggests the former. I will be adding a new Android device, an HTC One, to my network in the next few weeks and will try with that device to see if I have better results.<br /><br />Aside from not being able to use it for its intended purpose, I would like to mention that it does fit comfortably. I have large hands and wrists and I wasn’t sure if it would clasp around my wrist, but it does (with a couple of holes to spare). It is not so tight as to cut off circulate and not so loose as to slip and slide.

379,2.0,"case is waterproof, but audio is bad with it on, and wrist floater detaches by itself","The case seems really durable and I really like that it comes with an attachable wrist strap that can loop into the phone. I like to attach that with a carabiner to my pack for day hikes so it’s easily accessible. The package came with clear instructions for testing if the case is waterproof. My major complaint is that the Temdan, yellow, wrist float that came with the case is completely unreliable. So basically, even if your phone is in a waterproof case, it will likely end up at the bottom of a lake or the ocean. I took the wrist floater with me to do standup paddle boarding (SUP) I attached it to a carabiner that had my car key on it and then attached the carabiner to my life vest or PFD. The yellow floater popped off its connection THREE TIMES! We were practicing falling and getting back onto our boards, while on the lake, and other SUP people kept finding the yellow floater and giving it to me. The loop that would normally attach to your phone was still on the carabiner but the yellow floater part kept un-clipping itself and floating away! Thank goodness I didn’t attach to my phone or else my phone would be at the bottom of the lake now. Do not trust it with your valuables! Always have a direct second attachment (like a carabiner) to your body/clothing/life jacket. Also with my iphone 7, everyone I spoke with on the phone said it sounded like I was very far away or I sounded muffled like I was speaking from inside a box.

392,3.0,50% of content falls short of real function..,"One thing this world has shown us lately.. is how unpredictable it can be! Global pandemic, nuclear tension, EMP ability, insurrection, protest takeovers natural disasters, etc. I feel a moral responsibility to the x4 who call me mom to be ready + prepared as possible for a crises. If that makes me a prepper- I’m not sure? I think of it as just being a step ahead vs. the 2 steps behind I usually am..!!<br /><br />Choosing to create x1 universal “Grab/Go” bag of items- I ordered this survival kit to include. Only its content fell short of expectations with some of the important items- their real usability let me down.<br /><br />*Rule No.1 in getting prepared- its not about looks! A gimmick that gives false security.. is useless and that’s not ok!! If item can’t perform the function intended.. then, its taking up space and could leave you in a critical bind!! Prior to packing try items if possible to insure functionality.. this weeds out any useless or poor quality- ie, axe included looks the part but is size/strength for a child (hmm.. a child cant have an axe so now what?!) the universal tool.. it couldnt tight/loosen screw on my back door! It actually stripped it as if made of pewter and not stainless. *items MUST function! Already feeling a bit crazy making “lifesaver” pack- at very least I want to know- I was nuts putting in quality items that could help us- and if fears go away.. items I could incorporate for other intended uses!!<br /><br />I appreciate the hard case as it keeps content safe. But, with nothing secure- if accidental open.. items can spill and be lost! So, why 3 stars? (I wish to give this 50%.) Some items are universal and will suffice ie space blanket, glo stick, whistle, utensil, paracord etc. all can be of solid use.<br /><br />Overall, spending $40 I want true user ability or just include less so not to create false security. May prove helpful as add-on or a back up with bigger equipment. Kit is very small.. can fit inside ATV, etc so may be good for minimal situations.. I’m not upset by what it doesn’t include- you know that when ordering.

394,5.0,Excellent once you get in on,I own 3 of these for different bikes and the convenience on slidding the bag on and off can't be beat.  My first one which is also on the primary bike I have owned for three years and have not had any problems.  The only problem with this is getting it onto the bike without another person regardless of whether you are attempting to use it on a Schwinn or Trek bike.  On my new Schwinn the screw appeared to big for the hole however when I brought the bike to the bike shop the hole was clogged with paint and then it was discovered the hole was too long for the slot and would have interfered with the derailleur; but a quick change out with a screw used to hold the water bottle solved that problem.  One cautionary note is to place the bag fully loaded onto the rack once it is installed and check to make sure the weight of the bag is not causing the rack to rest on the rear brake assembly; if it is the problem is easily corrected by unscrewing the rack and placing it further away from he bike on the silver bracket slots.,0,"['different', 'bike', 'bag', 'first', 'one', 'also', 'bike', 'three', 'year', 'problem', 'problem', 'getting', 'onto', 'bike', 'without', 'another', 'person', 'use', 'bike', 'new', 'screw', 'big', 'hole', 'however', 'bike', 'bike', 'hole', 'paint', 'hole', 'long', 'quick', 'change', 'screw', 'used', 'hold', 'water', 'bottle', 'problem', 'one', 'note', 'place', 'bag', 'fully', 'onto', 'rack', 'installed', 'check', 'make', 'sure', 'weight', 'bag', 'rack', 'rest', 'rear', 'brake', 'assembly', 'problem', 'easily', 'rack', 'away', 'bike']"

We use wifi and while it did take more effort than I expected to get things set up, it seems to be working fine now.

It is retro all the way and looks much like an amp for a musical instrument looked in decades past. It even has actual knobs to control the volume, bass, and treble.

419,1.0,JUNK after less than 3 mos,"I am posting a ""reserved"" review...After the experience buying the black one for my husband and the first one arrived, opened and not working!  (BAD Amazon order fufillers sending an obviously opened and non-functioning product)  I have had my Shine for about a week... I wear in on my wrist most of the time.. I chose to remove it before bathing.  If I were swimming I would leave it on, although the propoganda states that if you wear in ""treated"" water it reduce it's life - odd to me.  Also, it doesn't auto sync.  You must sync it to your phone each day.  The upside is that you don't have to charge it, just replace the battery.  It seems to be fairly accurate.  I will update if there are any use/wear issues.  It arrived quickly (I have prime) and in good condition.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/15/2014..... So... I've been using the Shine for about a month... it hasn't failed, to my knowledge. It syncs when prompted to, although I have found sometimes it takes longer than others even though I set it right next to my phone each time.  It has survived one system ""update"" without noticeable issues. I chose to remove it when bathing. I do wish it auto synced rather than to manually prompt it to do so every morning.  I have learned that if you are interested in following your sleep pattern one night at a time (it doesn't provide a graph of experience, however you can review night by night - would be nice to have an over all view), you must use the wrist band.  Using the magnetic clip does not provide sleep info. Also note: when using the magnetic clip, be aware that it is HIGHLY likely to detach from you and attach to something else magnetic if it gets close and you may not even notice that you've left your Shine on something else.  The ""watch"" band seems to be very durable. The time option of the Shine is interesting and maybe entertaining for a short while, however, it is not as ""obvious"" as you might think.  It is very easy to misread. I found myself double-checking my phone a lot because I would think... hmm... my Shine says 5:30 but I KNOW it's 6:30. I eventually chose to ""turn off"" the watch function.  Which is another thing.. to change anything you must be attached to where ever you downloaded the progam, not an option on the Shine itself.  All of this is just information for those of you who are researching options.  Honestly, the best part of the Shine for me is the battery and not having to charge it each night or every few nights. I didn't think I would mind the wrist band, but I am bored with it and it's look now, which sometimes interfers with my jewelry options. I considered the necklace accessory, however, the reviews of it were overwhelming not so great, so I stuck with the wrist band and the clip that comes with it. Over all it seems to fairly accurately record movement. However, when this one fails, I am probably going to search out the next option unless they do the subtle upgrades mentioned above... but even then, I think I'm still looking for the device that works best for me.  Hope this info helps you in your research!<br />UPDATE: NOV 18 2014.... Sooo...about 2 months in and now it sometimes doesn't sync the sleep info. Randomly it just fails. And it would be nice if it would provide a graph or chart or some analysis of your sleep and workout info... but nope.  It does now sync with My fitness pal, which is a free easy way of keeping track of your food/calories.

423,5.0,Inexpensive solution for lighting a bike,"I received this set as a free review sample. What I like about them is they can be used as a temporary light set, since they are easily attached and removed from bikes. They will also augment existing lights, and especially of you have a front light, but are depending on a rear reflector to be seen at night.<br /><br />They are absolutely water resistant as claimed. I have owned mine for about six months and they are practically indestructible. Both the front and rear lights are sufficient to be easily seen in bad weather and at night. The front light is not the best path finder, so think of these as more of a safety light to be seen than as navigational lights in the dark.<br /><br />Mine are still running on the same sets of dollar store  batteries that I put in them five months ago, although I have not used these lights more than a few hours a month. When I have used them, though, it was usually in bad weather thanks to the daily storms we get in my part of the country during the summer months.<br /><br />Since they are removable you can quickly unlatch them from your bike and take them with you if you are worried about theft. They are small enough to literally fit in trouser pockets or in a purse - or backpack.

438,4.0,Good for a Spontaneous Workout,"Exercise is important, as I am sure most would agree. But often, it isn’t practical to pay a visit to a nearby gym- you need something that is easily accessible and that you can take with you, wherever you go, for a quick workout. A good option for your workout needs is Portable Pilates Bar Kit with Premium & Upgraded 30LB Thick Resistance Bands.<br /><br />Pulled from the package, this workout equipment is ready to use. All you need to do is attach the ends of the workout bar. At this point, you can use the foot loops to hold it down, then start exercising. There are several different ways you can use this simple piece of equipment. It can be used to tone different muscle groups depending on how it is used.<br /><br />You do get a fairly good amount of resistance from this workout bar, but there is no way to control the level of resistance. You have to take it the way it is, since there is no way to adjust it, that I can see. It seems to work fine for basic needs. Once you have used it for a while, I would guess that will no longer be sufficient- it will get too easy and you will likely need something with greater resistance. In other words, this cannot take the place of the sophisticated workout equipment in a well- stocked gym. But the best part about it is that, since it is so small and compact, you can use it whenever you need it.<br /><br />The best way to utilize the Portable Pilates Bar is to find different ways to do the exercises. I recommend going online and looking for different exercises so that you can workout different muscle groups.

It was so light weight that I questioned whether or not it was even made from wood. It is, but it's light weight wood! My parent's set was much heavier than this one. The paint job on the mallets is rather sloppy. The coat of paint doesn't cover the wood entirely and it goes over the edges in some spots. The mallets have to be screwed on to the sticks. No tools are required. If you want to store them back in the box, you have to take them apart. I would prefer a way to store them without having to do that.

This should produce some heat as well as light in those emergent situations.<br /><br />Update:  Having recently experienced a power outage when temps were near freezing I can say that using 2 put out enough heat to keep my bedroom tolerable for several hours.  I use the kerosene that is labeled as odorless but there is a slight odor.  It makes a bright flame but it is the heat that I needed most.  I now use it in the evening to get the chill out of the air when I am getting into bed and near my shower so its toasty when I get out.  I didn't plan on using it this way but it is a better option than my electric heater which costs a small fortune to operate.  This is a real bargain.

514,4.0,Review for those without tech savvy skills.. like me!!,"Bought for a specific purpose, I admit- im still not very well versed with all its features- but, learning as we go! Unfortunately, I have a daughter who fell victim to Covid-19 through contact tracing. Now, 10mo. post isolation.. she struggles greatly with physical side effects. At 23yr old, varsity collegiate athlete at the top of her game.. she has been plagued with chest pain, SOB, racing heart, dizzy spells, mostly when engaging in higher physical activity. Dr/trainer requested she begin tracking and recording everything: rigor of workouts, vitals, onset and severity of symptom..uh, how??!! We found the only way to do this with accuracy was to use a smart watch. Any others in this predicament may gain that detailed data to help them as well.. After all, knowledge is power and dr. need all info to help diagnose and create a plan for moving forward.<br /><br />This band fits really well and comfortable- after trying a “female” smart watch (thinner band) we found that connection was not solid- I’m guessing due to size? Having this larger face and band  eliminated our contact issues- and the fact it’s lightweight and surprisingly not constricting is a total bonus!! This watch does a solid job staying connected while wearing 24/7 (sleep, activity, water, scrimmages or otherwise!) Not to mention- it’s pretty cool in its futuristic transformer vibe! Yes!!! It does feel a bit masculine but, it works universally + functions for either sex! tbh, its sort of a tough, kick butt look! (we call this my kiddos  “Ironman heart..” ha! smile where you can, right?!!)<br /><br />Surprised to see how much data this truly can absorb and process via ones smart phone. As mentioned.. we’re still navigating all of it’s super powers. But, the basics are there: heart rate-pulse, pedometer, activity, GPS tracking.. and sleep (yes!! believe it or not- sleep matters so tracking can show signs of underlying issues- its good info to know!) I recommend reading instructions- but, keep them handy!! In play for x3wks. and we still reference everyday. **Hack: take photo of the manual with your phone- that way info is with you any time/place.. The photo has proven so handy!!<br /><br />A few quirks to mention are: the actual face display can be sensitive and changed to a different feature without intent! If there is a way to keep this from happening- we haven’t found it? Which leads me to  the other issue.. I understand technology advances and definitely above my pay grade- I freely admit. But, I like things I own to be fully understood after reading the manual. This gets an 85% in that department. I absorb some of the blame but I also realize there are more of “me’s” out there.. and this technology is NOT in our wheelhouse!

515,5.0,Great for bikes as well as general purpose flashlight,"I received this light as a review sample, which some folks will automatically discount since I was given it for free. If you are one, skip this and read the larger number of reviews from folks who actually shelled out money for this light and you will find that it's still a five star product.<br /><br />For me this light is not only great for bikes, but is a general purpose flashlight that I keep handy. It removes from the holder and will fit in a pocket or purse (or toolbox.) The main value is it not no only does an excellent job of illuminating near or far objects, but can be adjusted to focus on detailed work or even path finding with a twist of the lens. Plus it comes with a tail light too. That can actually be worn on the back of an adjustable ball cap.<br /><br />This only complaint I have - and it's minor - is the fine threading on the thumbscrew that allows you to attach this to handlebars. It takes quite a few turns to unscrew it completely. I will say, though, that once it's tightened it stays that way, and you need not remove the mount because the flashlight slides easily out of it with a few twists to loosen the mount screw for the flashlight encasing.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an excellent safety solution for biking at night, as well as a handy household (or vehicle) light for general purpose uses.",0,"['received', 'light', 'review', 'since', 'given', 'free', 'one', 'read', 'larger', 'number', 'review', 'actually', 'money', 'light', 'find', 'still', 'five', 'star', 'product', 'light', 'great', 'bike', 'purpose', 'flashlight', 'keep', 'handy', 'remove', 'holder', 'fit', 'pocket', 'main', 'value', 'doe', 'excellent', 'job', 'near', 'far', 'work', 'even', 'twist', 'plus', 'come', 'light', 'actually', 'worn', 'back', 'adjustable', 'ball', 'cap', 'complaint', 'fine', 'allows', 'attach', 'handlebar', 'take', 'quite', 'turn', 'completely', 'say', 'though', 'stay', 'way', 'need', 'remove', 'mount', 'flashlight', 'slide', 'easily', 'twist', 'mount', 'screw', 'flashlight', 'bottom', 'line', 'excellent', 'safety', 'night', 'well', 'handy', 'light', 'purpose']"

First and foremost, there is no way you are getting 5/6 people in this tent unless you're laying on top of each other.  I'd rate this tent at 3-4 max.  It was fine for my 8 year old, myself, and my dog but I could not imagine trying to squeeze more than 1 more person in there.<br /><br />The tent leaks.  This past trip I took it rained for an hour.  The rain started out heavy and within the first 10 minutes I could already see water pooling below the doorway zipper.  The corners of the tent also took in some water but nearly as bad as the doorway.  Thankfully it only rained heavy for about 30 minutes.  I laid a couple dirty shirts on the floor near the zipper to collect the water but I have strong doubts this tent would hold up to heavy rain for extended periods of time.<br /><br />Another issue I have, which isn't a huge one since this is the case with a lot of cheaper tents, are the ties for where you tie the rain fly to the poles and at the top.

577,3.0,Update - dead battery in 3 weeks!.,"Update Jan 23 2016. Downgrade two stars. I'm quite annoyed this morning because in less than 30 days, the so called 6 month life battery is completely dead. That means the unit is not functional at all and if I want to continue to use it, I have to trek to a store and buy a new battery. Really? Three weeks and it's already dead.<br /><br />*******original review follows*****<br />MOOV is the first fitness tracker that I have used and it's impressive by any standard. My primary concern about wearing one of these type devices was exposure to water and falling off when I am working with the horses. Ten days of nonstop wear (including in the shower every day) and the unit is still on my wrist and has shown no problems at all.<br /><br />I've done a few of the program work outs using the app on my phone and I really like the voice coaching in real time reaction to my speed, cadence, and distance. The connection between the tracker and my phone is instant. You get a visual breakdown on the app of your movement, moments of sloth and calories burned. Plus it keeps track of your progress as you improve each time you repeat a workout.<br /><br />All that is nice, but I have benefited the most from the MOOV's ability to track my sleep patterns and determine when and how long I'm actually sound asleep vs just a light sleep. What I've learned is that I need to go to bed earlier! I hardly notice that this thing is on my wrist now, mostly just when I choose to manually sync the tracker to the app. I am really looking forward to using the swimming options with it once it warms up and our pool isn't ice cold anymore.",1,"['update', 'two', 'star', 'quite', 'morning', 'less', 'day', 'month', 'life', 'battery', 'completely', 'mean', 'unit', 'want', 'use', 'store', 'buy', 'new', 'battery', 'really', 'three', 'week', 'already', 'original', 'review', 'first', 'fitness', 'used', 'standard', 'concern', 'wearing', 'one', 'type', 'device', 'water', 'falling', 'working', 'horse', 'day', 'wear', 'including', 'every', 'day', 'unit', 'still', 'wrist', 'problem', 'done', 'work', 'using', 'app', 'phone', 'really', 'like', 'real', 'time', 'speed', 'distance', 'phone', 'get', 'app', 'plus', 'keep', 'track', 'time', 'workout', 'nice', 'ability', 'track', 'sleep', 'long', 'actually', 'sound', 'light', 'sleep', 'need', 'bed', 'notice', 'thing', 'wrist', 'mostly', 'app', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'using', 'swimming', 'option', 'pool', 'ice', 'cold']"

603,2.0,"Work great, look awful. LOGO is big, bright, and horrible.","First of all, after installation they work fine. There is no rattle or excessive wobble.<br /><br />Also I should mention that I bought these in a hurry because I wasn't ready for my first commute in wet weather. I would ordinarily put a lot more time and effort into research.<br /><br />I put these on a bike I got for $40 on Craigslist and I STILL feel like these cheapen the look and feel of the bike. The big Planet Bike logo is a universe away from acceptable. It's bad enough that it advertises a brand with which I have no connection, but the logo itself feels cheap; it's on par with logos for local car dealerships, DBA web storefronts, and your mom's friend's hair salon. The logo is ugly, superfluous, intrusive - unacceptable. One star off for that but I really feel like I want to take two. There are only so many stars...<br /><br />The front fender is designed much better than the rear. The stays on the front terminate in good brackets for attaching to the fork. In the rear the design is much more slapdash. It's just bent wire, 1940's style. That's another star.<br /><br />The installation requires tools that many cyclists might lack. E.g. a Dremel to cut down the excess from the stays - or anything to cut and smooth the wire. The clip at the front of the rear fender requires some home mechanic engineering to attach it to the frame soundly with a bushing. I used a bit of inner tube rubber a zip tie, and extreme bending.<br /><br />There is nothing holding on the caps on the ends of the wire/rods so I assume at least one will be missing soon. This will take the fenders from cheap-looking territory straight to eyesore. BTW the finish on the plastic looks and feels very cheap. Three stars down.<br /><br />I put these on a 90's Hard Rock with street tires (Specialized Nimbus) and they work fine. OTOH since I put these on I like the bike less. It's ugly and looks and feels even slower than it was.<br /><br />IMO these fenders are cheap, ugly, AND overpriced.

The green is made of ""gator skin,"" which is far grippier than I thought. It can hold a grip in dry or wet skin and is neither irritant to the touch. The orange cap disassembles for cleaning and is very easy to open.<br />Here's where my one drawback is. With plastic Gatorade bottles, I'm used to squeezing it a bit to get more liquid out faster. With this, you obviously can't, and the orange lid allows for more of a trickle than a steady stream.

641,3.0,Reasonable price but not for every bike,"This bike bag is reasonably priced and provides adequate storage for wallet, keys, and a few other items.  The reason I am disappointed is because it does not fit my bike (my bike is a Trek Lime).  There is a back strap that is supposed to go behind the handlebars but the strap is so loose and cannot be tightened much so it just sags and provides no support.  Also, the straps did not securely fit the curvature of my bike handles that when I cinched it to the handlebars it drooped down almost to the front tire.<br /><br />Therefore, I tried to use this bag by cinching it to the rail above the pedals.  The fit was awkward and once I filled the pack with a cell phone and keys, it expanded and hit my legs when riding.  I decided to give this to my boyfriend--he loves it because it fits his bike fine.<br /><br />Although this is a decent pack for a good price, the manufacturer needs to improve on the back strap so that it can be adjustable by more than a few inches.  Also,buyers need to be aware that they may not be able to cinch this pack to their handlebars because of where the velcro straps are in relationship to the curvature of the handlebar.",1,"['bike', 'bag', 'priced', 'provides', 'storage', 'key', 'item', 'reason', 'disappointed', 'doe', 'fit', 'bike', 'bike', 'back', 'strap', 'supposed', 'behind', 'handlebar', 'strap', 'loose', 'much', 'provides', 'support', 'also', 'strap', 'securely', 'fit', 'bike', 'handle', 'handlebar', 'almost', 'front', 'tire', 'tried', 'use', 'bag', 'pedal', 'fit', 'filled', 'pack', 'phone', 'key', 'hit', 'leg', 'riding', 'decided', 'give', 'love', 'fit', 'bike', 'fine', 'although', 'decent', 'pack', 'good', 'price', 'manufacturer', 'need', 'back', 'strap', 'adjustable', 'inch', 'also', 'need', 'may', 'able', 'pack', 'handlebar', 'velcro', 'strap', 'handlebar']"

I step on, turn on, and let it do its thing. I am currently at 10 minutes max just standing on it. I'll aim for more over time. When I step off, my feet dont feel real so please be careful. Sometimes I add in squats. Kind of cool to do squats on this. Love the sensory input, and if I worked in an office, I would want to have this under my desk for anytime use. It isn't loud. Or I would pull it out and stand on it for mini breaks. Better yet, if I had a standing desk.<br /><br /> Remote takes two AAA batteries (not included).<br /><br />I'm 5'10.5"", 264 lbs.

FWIW, this thing is really heavy and sturdy, and I imagine it holds more weight than myself easily. That being said..<br /><br />Manual doesn't provide truly meaningful information. There are two pages of safety instructions, one page of parts list (why?), then a diagram of the components and how to attach ropes (helpful), then product maintenance, and a ""speed setting options"" graph, ie the Hz/S corresponding to level (really means nothing to me unless the Hz/S is qualified with perceived affect), then a page showing what the panel info means and remote control info. Problem solving. Different positions/postures (seriously, one is called ""groveling"" with clearly female image on her hands and knees). With no description of benefit. Last page has assortment of generic stretches recommendations. There is more info on moves that aren't related to the actual machine. Blegh.<br /><br />I would like to know more about what sort of affect certain levels are intended for. What does this machine actually do? Like ""here, here is this thing you step on. Turn it on."" That is the gist of what I get from the manual.<br /><br />Also, I cant seem to pair this via Bluetooth to anything I've tried. Maybe its on my end, but nothing happens. I will keep trying. I think the machine utters something about blue tooth, but there is nothing else to be said of it. The manual does not mention it at all. It has a USB port, which does not make it blue tooth. So maybe I will plug something in at some point. In the mean time, I just set this up near my TV.<br /><br />If you know what to do, and what you are using this for, and have no need of any helpful information, then this machine is surprisingly sturdy and provides lots of vibrations. I see other machines that include ebooks, video links, and more robust info. I just really expected something of this caliber to have an up to date manual and have more information. I see now that they say in the product description that their manual is not up to date and to refer to product page (not any more helpful), but that fries me.. I would not expect a customer (or what if I gave this as a gift?!) to have to track down the product page to learn about it since they couldnt bother to add in a relevant info.<br /><br />5 stars for vibration feel.

679,2.0,This is definitely not for the patient; it is useless to me for anything more than 2.5 lbs tension & quality is marginal,"I ordered this because it said it was also a finger exerciser for the patient and not only for the beginner guitarist o pianist. However, I am disappointed.<br /><br />I had carpal tunnel surgery on both my left and right hands in 2016. Due to carpal tunnel, I had no strength in my hands. In order to build strength, I purchased some of the same tools the therapist had in her office in addition to other tools that serve the same purpose as listed below. I wasted my money on the last two tensioners and wish I never purchased them. The first one is very light and only needed by someone who has no hand strength.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6JY CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Yellow, X-Light Tension (1.5 lbs per finger]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6GC CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Red, Light Tension (3 lbs per finger)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6KS CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Green, Medium Tension (5 lbs per finger)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6JO CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Blue, Heavy Tension (7 lbs per finger)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6HG CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Black, X-Heavy Tension (9 lbs per finger]]<br />[[ASIN:B000UMHUSI PRO Hand and Finger Exerciser, Extra-Heavy Tension (11 lbs per finger)]] - TERRIBLE GRIP, NOT RECOMMENDED<br />[[ASIN:B00KH3L7KC PRO Hand and Finger Exerciser, XX-Heavy Tension (13 lbs per finger)]] - TERRIBLE GRIP, NOT RECOMMENDED<br /><br />In addition to the above, I also ordered a [[ASIN:B01NBY83AE Gaiam Restore Easy Adjust Hand Grip]] which I found to be good but there is no way to know the tension on this grip.<br /><br />Since I own and use the above tools, I wanted to see how this compared. I expected two tensioners in one since it combined the tension of the the light and medium tensioners I have into one rated from 2.5 to 6 pounds.  The only thing I like about this exerciser is that this provides 2.5 lbs of tension per finger, which is another level of tension I do not have in my other devices. Other than this, it is useless to me.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br /><br />- The rubber grip on the bottom falls off easily and keeps falling off.<br /><br />- No instructions exist on how to adjust the tension or what each of the four tension levels equate to.<br /><br />- Third, to adjust the tension, the two ridges on each side have to be pushed in while the last finger piece has to be pulled out. There are four levels it can slide out to, but it is almost impossible to get those levels to set correctly every time and there is no tension indicator or notches on the unit. All I know is that the fully closed position is 2.5 lbs and the fully open position is 6 lbs but I am not sure what is in-between.<br /><br />- Lastly, the tension feels the same opened or closed. Apparently, it is just he positioning that is different and which provides a simulated tension level of over 2.5 lbs.

685,3.0,Just OK,"Let me start off by saying I've owned many of these cheap trackers, and this one isn't terrible at all. The color screen and the multiple faces is fun, but I hoped it would have more customization. I was really excited about the temp sensor, but I can't say it seems terribly accurate. Seems more like a gimmick. The step counter seems pretty accurate compared to other trackers including FitBit, Mi Band, a Michael Kors Wear OS and Samsung product I compared it to, and the battery life is pretty great as long as you don't have all the sensors running all the time (if you do constant heart rate monitoring, for example, expect to charge it every couple of days instead of weeks). I also like the way it charges, much like a similar product I've tried from Letscom. Rather than have a dedicated charger that might get lost in between uses, the charging port is behind the band! You remove one side, and plug the entire watch into a USB port to charge. I love this feature and have only seen in on a couple of other products. I wish more would adopt it instead of magnetic proprietary bases.<br />At the end of the day, if you just want basic step tracking, sleep tracking and phone notifications on a device that doesn't need to be charged so often, it's OK. Don't get it for the gimmicks like the HR monitor and temperature, I don't think those are accurate.

706,5.0,Extreme Protection for Summer in the Desert or Mountains,"We love to hike in the mountains near our Colorado home, but unfortunately, high-altitude sun and bugs can make the aftermath very uncomfortable.<br /><br />This hat has lots of protective options.

That alone will probably protect you from the sun (and rain).<br /><br />If you hate hats because they make your head sweat, you won't mind wearing this one. The crown is lightweight, flexible, and vented. It also has a cord to adjust the size of the hatband! At first, I thought it was a bit big, but that was easy to fix. Hatmakers have finally realized that wind exists and are including chin cords. This model has a nice one.  if those were the only features of this hat, it would probably would be enough, but wait, there's more.<br /><br />There's a snap-on back flat to keep sun, rain, ticks, mosquitoes, and black flies away from your neck and ears. There's also a flap in front that's vented for coolness and easy breathing. Admittedly, you'll look a little odd with both of these flaps snapped in place, but if you've been out hiking or fishing in the summer, you know others may be asking where you got it after they finish laughing.  In any case, the hat is very versatile. You can use one of the flaps or neither of them. They snap on and off. Lightweight synthetic fabric, they tuck into your pocket when not in use.

He knows weapons and accessories both on a professional and personal level. He has carried a weapon daily openly and concealed for well over 37 years. He decreed that this holster is at best useless and at worst, dangerous.<br /><br />First, it had no metal clip to attach to a belt. Second, the strap to secure the extra magazine is thin and easily undone by accident. Third and most importantly, the safety snaps are cheap, weak clothing style snaps. These snaps are supposed to hold your pistol securely in the holster - preventing an amateur mistake where it slips or slides up as you move. Instead, literally the lightest pressure pops the snaps loose unintentionally. That's a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because we can replace the straps ourselves in the shop and the rest of the physical holster is decently stitched and secure.

For the record, this one does not say anything about being Coast Guard Approved. In fact the booklet that comes with it says that it will not keep your face out of the water if you are unconscious.  I started looking up the requirements for PFD's in my state and for kayaking and canoeing, you need Coast Guard Approved ones. So I'm not really sure if I can even use this one. So keep that in mind. It's possible that these are similar to the ones that are CG approved, but they just didn't submit to the testing or fill out the paperwork. I do not know the answer.

763,1.0,The first Osprey product I’ve been disappointed with,"I had high expectations for this hip pack. I am a long time user of hydration backpacks while mountain biking (more than 20 years), and I wanted to try something different. After hearing about the benefits of getting weight off your shoulders and lowering your center of gravity, I thought this would be perfect. I’ve been extremely happy with my other Osprey backpacks and luggage, so this is a rare miss.<br /><br />The good news is there is plenty of room for water, food, tools, a tube, wallet, keys, and phone. With these items and a full 1.5 liters of water, it weighed 6 lbs, which is pretty light. However, the pack would not sit flat against my back as it poofed up like a balloon. It did not sit comfortably flat on my back until I drank probably 1/3 of the water. So it may work better starting out with less water on board.<br /><br />The other major issue I had was with the hose and magnet.  The magnet needs to be a lot stronger because the hose kept popping off when I rode through technical features. I wouldn’t even notice it until the trail smoothed out and I would feel it brushing up on my leg. I’d find the hose dangling precariously by my rear wheel. Also, compared to a backpack where I could immediately let go of the hose if needed, I had some sketchy moments trying to reattach the hose to the magnetic clip while steering around rocks and roots. I think it is just a matter of time before the bite valve gets destroyed by my wheel because the hose disconnected unexpectedly or I didn’t have enough time to reattach the hose and had to drop it.<br /><br />Another complaint, which may be due to the hip pack instead of a backpack or because of the bite valve design, I had to really suck on the bite valve to get a decent sized drink quickly. I’m used to just biting down and having the water pressure take care of getting a drink. It may only take fractions of a second longer than my trusty backpack, but it was getting annoying, especially on tough climbs where I was breathing hard.",1,"['high', 'hip', 'pack', 'long', 'time', 'user', 'backpack', 'mountain', 'year', 'wanted', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'getting', 'weight', 'shoulder', 'center', 'thought', 'perfect', 'extremely', 'happy', 'backpack', 'good', 'plenty', 'room', 'water', 'food', 'tool', 'tube', 'key', 'phone', 'item', 'full', 'water', 'pretty', 'light', 'however', 'pack', 'sit', 'flat', 'back', 'like', 'sit', 'comfortably', 'flat', 'back', 'probably', 'water', 'may', 'work', 'better', 'less', 'water', 'board', 'issue', 'need', 'lot', 'kept', 'feature', 'even', 'notice', 'trail', 'feel', 'leg', 'find', 'rear', 'wheel', 'also', 'compared', 'backpack', 'immediately', 'let', 'needed', 'trying', 'clip', 'around', 'think', 'matter', 'time', 'valve', 'get', 'wheel', 'didn', 'enough', 'time', 'drop', 'another', 'complaint', 'may', 'due', 'hip', 'pack', 'instead', 'backpack', 'valve', 'design', 'really', 'valve', 'get', 'decent', 'sized', 'drink', 'quickly', 'used', 'water', 'pressure', 'take', 'care', 'getting', 'drink', 'may', 'take', 'second', 'longer', 'backpack', 'getting', 'annoying', 'especially', 'hard']"
764,3.0,Only 1 problem.,"I just started using this and so far I like it except for one reason.  The cable extends out of the handle off center. I consider this a design flaw.  While using it, the weight feels off balance. One side needs more force than the other. It would be like curling with a 20 pound weight in one hand and a 25 pound weight in the other.  So to accommodate this I switch the cable side to a different hand each set.  In one photo the cable is wrapped around the bar several times and looks like it is centered.  I suppose that might help to alleviate the imbalance issue but I haven't tried it yet.

Very nice set!,"I ordered the 'Professional Steel Tip Darts Set - USA American Flag and Patriotic Bald Eagle Inspired Colors - Customizable Configuration 6 Steel Tip Darts |Shafts |Standard Flights | O-Rings | Darts Tool| Sharpener' to review.<br /><br />I have to say first off that I am not, nor have I ever been a professional Dart player. My experience has been purely recreational and to be honest, it's been close to 30 years since I really played. So when I had the opportunity to order and review this set, I was excited to give it a go. When I first opened this set I was absolutely blown away at the quality and options that come with this Dart set. The last time I played, I used plastic molded darts with dull steel tips. Btw, the steel tips with this set are nice and sharp out of the box!<br /><br />This set has options. You can choose from the pre-installed aluminum flight shafts or the included plastic flight shafts. You can choose from standard flights, or the included smaller flights. The flights are a nice quality plastic and are a bit tricky to install at first as they are a really tight fit into flight shafts. The set also comes with extra O rings, a tip sharpening tool and a dart tool. What, a Dart tool? I never knew there was a such thing haha.<br /><br />This is a great Dart set and though I am not a professional Dart player, I would most definitely consider this a professional set.

773,4.0,Realistic-Looking Crankbait,"Most of my freshwater fishing involves hunting for largemouth bass. I use predominantly artificial lures like this one though I do occasionally use live bait when the fish get especially finicky. I have been experimenting with this bait in one of my favorite lakes and it seems to be a decent bait even though I have not yet caught anything with it. I had hoped to write this review with a picture of a fish caught with this bait but it has not worked out for me yet. (I will revise next spring once I catch one with it.)<br /><br />This is a large, segmented minnow and it is well-suited for the voracious appetites of larger bass. It is approximately 5” long, a bit bigger than a small fish can handle (which is good – you don't need to waste time catching the little guys). I have the yellow version which looks a little bit like a brown trout.<br /><br />The lure has 8 connected segments, all joined on a fibrous, narrow strip of some manner of fabric. The distance between the segments is small but it is enough to allow freedom of movement so the segments can undulate as the bait is pulled through the water. It seems to have very realistic motion. There is enough flex to allow some vertical motion but it is limited.<br /><br />This bait sinks but has no bill so it needs to be cast and allowed to descend. When reeling, if you crank too fast it will end up back on the surface, so it really is not suitable for trolling or fast retrieves. It's a slow retrieve bait. With some practice I have been able to keep it at the depth I want.<br /><br />I have two observations about this lure that merit mention, neither of which are showstoppers but both need to be kept in mind. First, this lure is a little frustrating in weedy or grassy water. More than once I have gotten weeds in the segments during the retrieve which requires stopping to pull off the weeds when at the end of the retrieve. Second, the rear treble hook occasionally gets hooked over the tail and I have yet to get it to right itself without actually putting hands on it. Neither of these are major issues but they are enough to aggravate on occasion.<br /><br />This is a nice fishing lure, well made and it has good action. I like the colors and it looks very much like a trout. Be aware that this is a slow-retrieve bait and it does not dive.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

774,1.0,"Well, you get what you pay for...","Initially I was fascinated with the notion we now have decent fitness trackers with limited smartwatch capabilities for $25-$30. Well, that idea went into the trash almost immediately, as I became acquainted with what the Wyze band can and more importantly--cannot--do. The Wyze band is a lot of things, and great isn't one of them.<br /><br />First, let me say, clearly, that for $25 or $30, this is a hard device to beat. If you keep your expectations (very) low, in line with the very low price of the unit, you will not be disappointed. The biggest frustration initially was with the lack of clear, helpful instructions. The instructions tell you it is charged out of the box, and that you should plug it in to charge to activate it. Um, okay. The home bar pulses when it is plugged in to the charger, leading you to think it is charging. Perplexingly, there is no charge indicator in the default display configuration while it is charging, so you just think it is still charging. In fact, pretty much everything in the default factory configuration is disabled, including Alexa, even once you set up your Alexa info in the app. Notifications are disabled by default, so nothing talks to the band. You have to turn on notifications, and then scroll through the entire list of all the apps on your phone to enable notifications for each specific app, including calendar reminders, messages, etc. Problem is, nowhere in the documentation (even online) does it tell you this step is necessary. People who are not comfortable messing around with their devices will be frustrated quickly. Nothing is intuitive, and there is no real guidance. It's fiddle-around time--geeks (like me) will be comfy with this. The average consumer will not be impressed at all, and may become quite frustrated.<br /><br />However, set up frustrations aside, it's the things the Wayz band lacks which may disappoint the consumer. It's a long list, but again, remember this thing is dirt cheap. To begin with, the band has no external speaker. This means Alexa’s responses, when you can raise them (which is by no means assured), are in text on the screen in a *tiny* font.  In fact, this tiny font is everywhere. If you wear glasses for reading, you will definitely need them to use this band. This means if you are out walking or running, and you're not wearing your glasses, the band is almost useless. This is where not having a speaker is a real detriment: Alexa cannot speak responses, and without my glasses I can't read them. This is due to the very small screen which is  only 240 x 120 pixels. There simply isn't enough screen real estate for a larger font. This screen is *tiny*, and feels about half the size of the screen on an Apple watch. Another design issue worth noting, the band is the cheapest design I have ever seen, and it both looks and feels like it. The plastic clasp feels like it may break at any moment. Also, if you have large wrists like I do, you’re potentially out of luck. The Wayz band ships with only one band, and no larger band seems to be available.<br /><br />You cannot really interact with this band much, which limits functionality. You can read your incoming text messages and notifications in that teeny tiny font, but you can't reply (or if you can, I've no idea how, as this is not covered anywhere and doesn't seem to be possible). You also cannot dismiss all notifications at once, and will have to scroll through all of them, dismissing them one at a time. A word to the wise: be conservative about which apps you allow to send notifications to the band. If you are all in, you are going to spend a LOT of time dismissing notifications. With the exception of talking to Alexa, which requires you to touch the screen, communication with this band is almost entirely one-sided--you cannot input anything on the band at all, and you must use the app on your phone to interact with it--which begs the question… why am I wearing this again?<br /><br />Wyze have also not included the ability to control music playback (or anything else) from your phone. With the exception of the heartbeat monitor and sleep tracker, this device primarily functions as a tiny supplemental screen for your phone to give you alerts (and the haptic buzz is STRONG). From what I can tell, the sleep tracking, step counter, and heart rate monitoring are far from accurate, rendering this device mostly useless. Also, if your activity of choice is not walking, running, or jogging, you’re out of luck--it can’t track anything but steps and heart rate, and as it seems to consistently get those wrong, it really does sort of feel like a waste of $30. Perhaps more than anything else, the Wyze band serves as a great advertisement for other, superior fitness trackers, as all the shortcomings of this device just make me want to get a really good fitness tracker/smartwatch and toss this thing.<br /><br />It should be noted there is also as serious issue with the way the band communicates with the phone. This really was not well-designed at all on the app side. In order for the band to interact with your phone, the WYZE app MUST be running on your phone at all times.

If you've got a decent sized back yard, or even a large basement that gives little ones enough room to move around, you'll get them running and laughing with this kit.<br /><br />It takes a little bit of time to put the net together and I wish the instructions had been printed in a bigger font because they were hard to see. However, the construction is pretty intuitive and it goes together easily. Some components of the net are held together with Velcro so you can fold it down and put it in the trunk of your car for a trip to the park.<br /><br />The set comes with a little air pump and a needle that gets the job done along with a small, rubber soccer ball. It also has one small ball that feels like it's made out of tough foam, and three squishy balls that are perfect for juggling or sticking to the back of the net. It also includes a birdie. Two knee hockey sticks and two badminton rackets complete the set.<br /><br />This is a good starter sports kit that is tough enough for rough play, but is kid friendly and safe.

I took this out on the deck and opened/closed it at least a dozen times. In at least half of the attempts, the umbrella didn't click into place when fully extended. I had to retry it again and sometimes again. The handle is easy to hold and grip. It's also comfortable when holding it for longer periods of time. I haven't had to go out in the rain since this arrived, but with the other inverted umbrellas, I do like how it's easy to use when getting in or out of the car. And of course I really like how when you have a wet umbrella, the moisture closes inside keeping you from getting hit with more water.

This is not your swimming pool float quality. Once it is inflated, you can see how sturdy and firm it is. I was able to set this up on my own for the most part. It does take a little bit of time to inflate. It took about 5 minutes to get it looking like a paddleboard, but it took at least another 5 minutes to get it to a PSI of 12. It took a little longer to get it up to 15 PSI which is the recommended minimum. My husband took over after my 5 minutes because I was getting tired! We will definitely want to invest in an electric pump. A manual pump is included and it's also recommended for deflating it as well. I tried to deflate it without the pump and it did release a lot of the air by just sitting there. But it wasn't enough to pack it back up so we used the pump again. It comes with a paddle that can be converted to the 2 types of paddles - kayak & paddleboard. The seat is easy to install with clips/D-Rings. There's a repair kit.

806,2.0,These are not as reflective as I had hoped they would be; wish I had invested the money in a vest instead,"I purchased a black pair of these gloves at Marshall's for $4.99 ($10 off the current Amazon price) so that I have something reflective on when I walk in the dark of night. Although, I do wear blinking lights on my backpack and one on my cap, I wanted something for the body other than wearing a vest.<br /><br />On the positive side, these gloves are thin but have a felt interior that keeps my hands warm when walking. They are like texting gloves but without any finger slots. Four fingers slip through the top and the thumb through the side and all fingers remain exposed. What I don't like about them is that both my friend who I walk with and I do not find these particularly illuminating. When a car's headlights hit them, the design on the gloves are supposed to reflect back. However, they are only mildly reflective in my opinion. Had I known this I actually wouldn't have purchased them even at the low price of $4.99.<br /><br />On the other hand, if one wants texting gloves without finger holes for four fingers, then this will do fine.

807,2.0,good mate for a department store bike,"More evidence that there's no free lunch. I really wanted a Burley Nomad I saw on Craigslist for $100, but I was too slow and missed it. I should have either waited to find another used Burley or just paid the steep price for a new one. I wanted those three things you can't have all at the same time: fast, good, and cheap.<br /><br />The Allen Explorer trailer is okay, and I do use it every week for groceries for me and the wife. For that purpose it gets me by with no problems. If that's all I wanted to do with a bike trailer it would be fine.<br /><br />However, I have just started cycling to gigs (I'm a musician) and when I need to bring my own amp it's really awkward. When I think about covering real miles with a trailer my gut feeling is that this one is heavy, slow, and prone to wearing out faster than one made with an aesthetic/ethic/IDK similar to the bicycle itself - you know, ultralight, rigid, smooth rolling, made to last for decades or more.<br /><br />Lately every time I have to drive my car I curse this trailer and start thinking about biting the bullet and paying for a Burley.<br /><br />Besides the weight and general clunkiness of the trailer, a couple things stand out as reservations regarding a recommendation on the Allen Explorer. First, the tires are pretty weak, as others have pointed out. 30 PSI is no joke - I had a blowout after I forgot and pumped them up to 50, which is what is embossed on the tire itself; but I was able to ride home with no inner tube - even with a load of groceries - so mark a point for the cheap tires. The other thing that bugs me is that the floor of the trailer is nowhere close to rigid. It hasn't caused any problems yet, but it makes feel less enthusiastic about this trailer, and pretty much rules it out as a long-distance candidate.<br /><br />For anyone thinking about getting this trailer, I would just advise you to think long and hard about what you might possibly want to do with it. Don't be like me; I've had this thing less than a year and I'm already thinking about putting down another $340 for a trailer that is very similar but very much better.

816,5.0,Keep it clean!,"A responsible gun owner does the following: (1) identifies a safe place to store the weapon; (2) attends training on how to use the weapon (properly); (3) knows how to clean the weapon; and (4) purchase the proper safety equipment to use while at the range (i.e., ear and eye protection). This Guard Tech Plus universal gun cleaning kit addresses #3. It is great. It comes with all the accessories needed for cleaning multiple-caliber weapons. The carrying case and the way the accessories are organized inside makes this relatively easy (a no-brainer) when cleaning a firearm.

One thing I don’t like is the mesh metal band. It snags on everything, clothing, hair, bedding any fabric. The hair thing is especially annoying. I’d recommend the non mesh bands. But the look of the mesh is cool. Also the magnet closure is always coming lose. It slides around and just isn’t tight enough. I fiddle with it a lot.

They were super easy to use--just pulled them out, wrapped around the tree, and I had my hammock set up in just a few short minutes.  The only thing was that I had to add additional knots on both because even with the trees being the perfect distance, the knots weren't high enough on the slings to hold the hammock up (I'm also short, so I can only place them so high, but my brother, who is over 6 foot, still couldn't get them high enough without the new knots).  The great thing is, you CAN add knots, so it just took a second or two to knot, and then I was swinging away in my hammock.

871,4.0,Fantastic design!,"Initial impressions:  I  bought a few of these to experiment with as I was more used to the HKS design with the twist knob.  I think this speedloader is ingeniously designed.  The reviewers that are griping about the difficulty of use?  I don't get it.  You literally put it upside down, seat your bullets, push and twist to lock into place.  When you expel your rounds you simply push the speedloader into place, when it hits the ejector star the rounds will release.  Viola!  Close your cylinder and you're reloaded for the next round of targets.  I just received these, so I'm reserving them at a 4 star with a potential updated review once I've used them a while.  My only concerns out of the package are the build material of plastic used in the locking &#34;mechanism&#34;.  This could potentially cause a longevity issue but I'm reserving judgement until I actually see it fail.  I had also hoped these would work with my LCR line of 38's, but they do not unfortunately.  I had read mixed reviews of guys using these speedloaders with the LCR brand.  I'm not sure how they're doing it.  I even tried taking off the grips to see if it would work.  Possibly it works with the .357 framed variety, but most certainly will not allow seating to unlock the bullets in the .38spl LCR revolvers.  It will not permit the speedloader to clear the frame.  They do work really well with J-Frames and my SP101, so I'm keeping them to use with those revolvers.  If they hold up, I'd buy these over the HKS line as the actual funciton is more intuitive when reloading and most certainly faster.",0,"['bought', 'used', 'design', 'twist', 'knob', 'think', 'designed', 'use', 'get', 'literally', 'put', 'seat', 'push', 'twist', 'lock', 'place', 'round', 'simply', 'push', 'place', 'hit', 'star', 'round', 'release', 'close', 'next', 'round', 'received', 'star', 'review', 'used', 'concern', 'package', 'build', 'material', 'plastic', 'used', 'cause', 'issue', 'actually', 'see', 'also', 'work', 'line', 'unfortunately', 'read', 'review', 'guy', 'using', 'brand', 'sure', 'even', 'tried', 'taking', 'grip', 'see', 'work', 'work', 'variety', 'certainly', 'allow', 'clear', 'frame', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'frame', 'keeping', 'use', 'hold', 'buy', 'line', 'actual', 'certainly']"

894,1.0,UPDATED REVIEW!,"UPDATED: This lantern didn't last more than a year an a half. I think we used/recharged it around half a dozen times. Super wasteful and expected long lasting quality from this name brand.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />This lantern is so bright and awesome! This is easy to use and feels really well made. The clear plastic is very thick; I would consider the plastic to be as thick (if not thicker) than a name brand water bottle. It should be able to take a beating. And the color the lantern throws off isn't too ""white"" and eye straining either, unlike like the old vintage lanterns had.<br />The mini flashlight on top is nice too, especially for when you don't want to light up the entire tent space.<br />The only thing I don't love about it so far is the red USP cord is short. But those cords are a dime a dozen and we have many around the house, so it's was not a deal breaker for us. Also know the removable battery is kind of big. I barely consider the battery pocket sized. But love that it is multipurpose and that I can charge another device off of it if necessary.

916,3.0,Stand in Place and Putt Away!,"Golf is one sport for which there is always room for improvement. And one of the areas where many struggle is putting. Getting the grip, the aim, the stroke, and everything else just right takes time and effort and Club Champ is here to help with the task.<br /><br />With this Club Champ product, you get nine feet of putting area to practice and improve your skill. The carpet comes folded and it can take time to work out the creases, but once flattened you are ready to grab a golf ball, your favorite putter, and start practicing.<br /><br />Probably the best feature of this Club Champ product is the ball return. It works well and continuously sends the ball back to you. I like that I can stand in one place and putt the ball over and over again. This makes it nice not just for putting practice, but also for kids who can entertain themselves without much frustration.<br /><br />It’s cool to have a way to practice one’s putting, but there are problems with this product that lead me to lower my rating. The biggest issue I have is with the construction. It is made about as cheaply as possible, apparently for maximum profits. And yes, the design, with its sticker “traps” for sand and water and its background of trees is silly. But it’s the construction that bothers me the most. With repeated use, it’s only a matter of time until the putting green tears or something breaks.<br /><br />My overall opinion of this Club Champ product is average overall. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, but I will go ahead and give it 3 because it does succeed at what it was intended to do: Help you practice putting and returning the ball so that you won’t have to chase it down. Take away the ball return feature and it would lose its appeal, but as it stands, it’s acceptable enough to earn a slight recommendation.",1,"['golf', 'one', 'always', 'room', 'one', 'area', 'many', 'putting', 'getting', 'grip', 'everything', 'else', 'right', 'take', 'time', 'effort', 'help', 'product', 'get', 'foot', 'putting', 'area', 'practice', 'come', 'take', 'time', 'work', 'ready', 'golf', 'ball', 'favorite', 'start', 'probably', 'best', 'feature', 'product', 'ball', 'return', 'work', 'well', 'ball', 'back', 'like', 'stand', 'one', 'place', 'ball', 'make', 'nice', 'putting', 'practice', 'also', 'kid', 'without', 'much', 'cool', 'way', 'practice', 'one', 'putting', 'problem', 'product', 'lower', 'rating', 'issue', 'construction', 'made', 'cheaply', 'possible', 'yes', 'design', 'sand', 'water', 'tree', 'construction', 'use', 'matter', 'time', 'putting', 'green', 'something', 'break', 'overall', 'opinion', 'product', 'average', 'overall', 'star', 'give', 'doe', 'intended', 'help', 'practice', 'putting', 'returning', 'ball', 'won', 'take', 'away', 'ball', 'return', 'feature', 'lose', 'stand', 'enough']"

923,5.0,"One of my new go-to bits, highly recommended","I was a little cautious to try this bit at first, being so different from usual and a little on the thin side. But after trying it on a few horses it's become one of my go-to bit (and I'm pretty particular). The joints give it a nice amount of play and provide some tongue relief. The greenies really seem to like it and it's been great for introducing horses to contact. They get a nice firm feel they can trust, and the fact the sides can move independently give them an introduction to a the greater independent movement they'll experience from more mobile bit (like double joints).<br /><br />Far from being too thin, I find the bits fit horses' bars much better than, say, a rubber bit or happy mouth, which are often either too thick to be comfortable or just too much bulk in a green horse's mouth. There's enough bulk for the horse to feel and trust, but it's thin enough that if you need control it's there - unlike a rubber bit. I was concerned the joints might pinch but I haven't seen any sign of horses acting like it does. And it's surprisingly flexible, curving into a nice C shape which again has a clear limit the horse can trust when introducing contact.<br /><br />The D rings help the but from sliding as well as make turning cues more understandable - when turning the opposite side D pushes on their lips to bring the head around, it's not just pressure on the inside bar.<br /><br />I've been entirely thrilled with the response from this bit, and it's my new go-to greeny bit. Every horse I've put it in seems to really like it and I've seen dramatic improvements in contact over too-remedial rubber/plastic bits, and too advanced highly mobile bits. Also an excellent choice for horses who like a quiet bit, or a rider with noisy hands.  My horses have given me light and amazingly consistent contact - the only horse I'd recommend against using this bit on is one who wants to be extremely heavy in the contact by leaning on the hand (usually this begins from rider error btw),  who prefers a bit with a lot one movement of play, or one with a bull-neck who locks against the bit (I think you could still handle that in this bit if the rider is comfortable).<br /><br />Anyways I love this bit and highly recommend it for greenies or restarts with mouth issues.

No one ones to be the one who sits in a chair and causes it to break! My adult son is a big guy at about 300 pounds. He can easily sit in this chair, without worrying about it. We also have a few big guys in our friend group. I'm pleased that we have a chair that will accommodate them. It feels sturdy and well made. It only has one cup holder, and it's the size of a regular can of soda. I was a little disappointed with that. Today, so many chairs have two cup holders and even side pouches.

My two younger daughters will hopefully be taking swimming lessons this summer, but for now products like these give them a sense of independence in the water.<br />But be careful- by no means should this independence mean you leave them unattended in the deep end, and it honestly does not help them learn actual swimming skills. However what it does do is give them confidence. Much like training wheels, it helps them enjoy the experience before they are learning to do it properly, but you have to make sure they don't rely on it when it is time to learn how to do the real thing.<br />Plus for us is that this is pretty and pink, unlike our other puddle jumper brand one.

They were more expensive than the shears I'd been using and were reccomended by the salesperson where he bought them, so he figured they would be a better quality tool overall.<br /><br />It was a very nice gesture on my husband's part, but these shears turned out to be a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The handles are probably the absolute worst design feature on these shears!  They are skinny and hard...does not offer much stability and the hard rubber becomes unbearably uncomfortable after a while. The little nubby grippy things do nothing but dig into your skin.  I was beginning to form blisters by the time I'd cut the feet & wings off of 5 birds.  If the handles got even a little bit slick, my grip became very unstable; hands sliding down the handle as I'd squeeze to cut through bone.<br /><br />The bone notch on the blade could be designed better too; it didn't seem to be deep enough to really grab & hold onto the bone as I was cutting.  Other shears have a bone notch that's almost a half-circle.  It's the perfect shape to hold onto the bone & give you the best leverage to snip right through.  With these shears, if you don't carefully ensure the bone is situated JUST right in the little divot before you start squeezing, the bone will just slide down the blade and you'll end up trying to cut it with the middle of the blade which tends to work poorly.<br /><br />The other major issue I had with these shears is that they bound up every time I cut through feathers & skin.  When cutting through wings and especially tails, they'd bind up every time. Seemed like the blades just weren't sharp enough...but brand new, they should have been!  Granted, most shears will bind up if you try to cut through a huge wad of feathers all at once or go in at the wrong angle...but these did it every. single. time. A pair of child's safety scissors might have done a better job.  I even tried tightening the screw in the middle since it seemed like it wasn't tight enough....because I'd squeeze the blades closed as I made my cut and the feathers would all end up packed between the blades with a 1/8 inch seperation between them.  I eventually realized it wasn't a loose screw, but rather the blades were flexible enough to *bend* when they got bound up on feathers and skin.  Basically, I'd have to use the shears to break through the bone, then I was better off just ripping the wings and tails off by hand to prevent getting the shears bound up on them.<br /><br />I made it through about 10 birds before I'd had enough.  I had raw, cramped hands and I was having to manually rip appendages off of gamebirds.  I still had 60 something birds left to clean and I was already exhausted.  Something was wrong with this picture.  I gave up and went back to my old shears, which were cheap (about half the price of these) dull, rickety and in need of replacing.....yet compared to the struggle I'd just put up with, they made the job seem effortless.<br /><br />If you're a casual hunter who just likes to go out & shoot your limit a few times a year, these shears might be more than sufficient for you.  If you're using them for smaller birds like quail, or for fish, they'd probably work fine.  But if you need a pair of shears that'll stand up to heavier use for extended periods of time, while still being easy to handle and comfortable to work with....these are NOT the shears to buy.",1,"['clean', 'game', 'cleaning', 'one', 'night', 'husband', 'bought', 'pair', 'last', 'year', 'gift', 'expensive', 'using', 'bought', 'better', 'quality', 'tool', 'overall', 'nice', 'husband', 'part', 'turned', 'huge', 'handle', 'probably', 'design', 'feature', 'hard', 'doe', 'offer', 'much', 'hard', 'rubber', 'uncomfortable', 'little', 'thing', 'nothing', 'skin', 'time', 'cut', 'foot', 'handle', 'got', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'grip', 'hand', 'handle', 'cut', 'blade', 'designed', 'better', 'seem', 'deep', 'enough', 'really', 'hold', 'onto', 'almost', 'half', 'perfect', 'shape', 'hold', 'onto', 'give', 'best', 'right', 'right', 'little', 'start', 'slide', 'blade', 'end', 'trying', 'cut', 'middle', 'blade', 'work', 'issue', 'every', 'time', 'cut', 'skin', 'especially', 'every', 'time', 'seemed', 'like', 'blade', 'sharp', 'enough', 'brand', 'new', 'try', 'cut', 'huge', 'wrong', 'every', 'single', 'time', 'pair', 'child', 'safety', 'might', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'even', 'tried', 'screw', 'middle', 'since', 'seemed', 'like', 'tight', 'enough', 'blade', 'closed', 'made', 'cut', 'end', 'blade', 'inch', 'loose', 'screw', 'rather', 'blade', 'enough', 'got', 'skin', 'basically', 'use', 'break', 'better', 'hand', 'getting', 'made', 'enough', 'hand', 'still', 'something', 'left', 'clean', 'already', 'something', 'wrong', 'picture', 'gave', 'went', 'back', 'old', 'cheap', 'half', 'price', 'need', 'yet', 'compared', 'put', 'made', 'job', 'seem', 'like', 'time', 'year', 'might', 'using', 'smaller', 'like', 'fish', 'probably', 'work', 'fine', 'need', 'pair', 'stand', 'heavier', 'use', 'time', 'still', 'easy', 'handle', 'comfortable', 'work', 'buy']"

1010,3.0,"May not be the popular opinion, but...","So I saw this grill come up and it was perfect timing because the family was going camping.  We needed a new grill so I grabbed this one.  It's very well reviewed and I thought I couldn't go wrong.  After a fair bit of use, I sort of wish I had chose something more standardized.<br /><br />The unit I received is relatively fine although I do have some issues when opening / closing the unit.  For instance, the right temperature knob pops off every time I open the grill.  It's easy enough to slide back on.  The support rod on the same side also tends to pop out of it's slot.  Again, not a big deal since I can easily pop it back in place.  The grill surface, when the unit is open and on a level surface, seems unlevel usually.  All of these issues I'm sure can be corrected if I just take the time to bend whatever pieces of metal back into place because I assume it's just some sort of alignment issue.  The wire for the piezo adapter pulled off the burner one time while opening the unit which is something I wouldn't have expected to happen.  The big problem I have with them is the fact their adapter is set up for their own bottles.  I ended up investing in their refill kit and a few additional bottles but they are not cheap.  If you look around you can get them for around $25 a bottle and the refill kit you can get for around $35.  Regardless, you are not going to just buy some camping propane bottles from Walmart and expect them to work.<br /><br />I just feel there are cheaper alternatives out there which will allow you to go buy 1lb propane bottles anywhere and use them.

1015,5.0,Beach/Picnic Blanket that Doubles as a Table Cloth,"The picnic blanket that we have used for years is a classic red and white checker pattern vinyl rectangle. It's fine for small outings and it does provide a moisture barrier but it is small and not suitable for more than just one or two people. This is a very different blanket, suitable for picnics and for the beach and much better suited for larger groups.<br /><br />Unlike a terrycloth blanket or a vinyl sheet, this blanket is made of parachute nylon which has the advantages of being very lightweight and water resistant. It also is very non-bulky and folds up into a small and compact bundle in the *attached* bag, to a size that is slightly smaller than the average purse. I would not have thought it would pack this small, but it's absolutely perfect for packing for a trip.<br /><br />When completely unfolded this blanket is 7'x7', more than adequate for a group of 4-6 people. Being as light as it is, without anchoring at the corners it can easily get caught in the wind and blow around. So, each corner has a small elastic loop and included with the blanket is a set of 4 small stakes so that it can be better anchored down. Additionally, there are pockets on the corners so that additional weight can be added (rocks or sand) which helps even more when the ground is not suitable for relying solely on stakes. The packing bag doubles as a stash bag for things like sunglasses or a phone or it can be used to hold trash items until it's time to pack up again.<br /><br />Though this is marketed predominantly a blanket it is more useful to me and to my family as a table cloth for picnic tables. Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park has several picnic areas that are wonderful places to stop and spend time for lunch and this blanket covers those picnic tables nicely. The packing bag again serves double duty - it works well for holding utensils (spoons, ladles, etc.) while the blanket is spread on the table and it can again hold small amounts of trash until packing up to leave.<br /><br />This blanket is a very simple but very nice product that serves multiple purposes. It's fine for use on the beach and it works just for as a picnic blanket but it's just as useful as a picnic table cover. It packs up very nicely and is extremely portable and is not unreasonably priced.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

It has brighter white light, dimmed light and a warning red light.<br /><br />OPEN<br />Open this has the ability to zap bugs.<br /><br />HOW WELL DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This performs well as a light, but as a bug zapper, it really is not the season for heavy bugs like we will be having later in the season.  I have not been able to catch the few tiny moths in the house, nor the few tiny fruit flies.  That is no surprise, however, because this zapper is not very big and these guys have been all over the house.<br /><br />The light part is nice for using when necessary to see at night.  During power outages it also will be handy.<br /><br />HOW THIS RUNS<br />This runs not only on USB charging,, but also works with AAA batteries(3) which don't come with it.<br /><br />CHARGE TIME<br />This took a couple of hours to charge up fully and it lasts a few hours depending on how it is used.  I usually charge after that, so I have not let it run completely down yet.<br /><br />CAN IT HANG FROM CENTER OF TENT?<br />This does make a good light for hanging from the center of the tent when you want to see with an overhead light.  It also would do well in that position as a bug zapper.  It has a handle so you can twist tie it to the loops.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For using at a camp site or on a deck in summer, this is a nice little light to have at the table at night, or use for walking at night around a camp site.  As for bug zapper, in the tent, I would have to have some eye masks to sleep with.  The light would be too bright for me to sleep with.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  If this turns out to be a bug zapping wonder, I will stop by and update my rating on this zapper/light.  As it is now, it works, seems to do what it is supposed to do, but situations are not dire enough to see how good it really is.",0,"['trying', 'get', 'various', 'bug', 'family', 'area', 'close', 'plug', 'one', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'come', 'come', 'small', 'box', 'instruction', 'closed', 'closed', 'used', 'light', 'white', 'light', 'light', 'red', 'light', 'open', 'open', 'ability', 'bug', 'well', 'doe', 'well', 'light', 'bug', 'really', 'season', 'heavy', 'bug', 'like', 'later', 'season', 'able', 'catch', 'tiny', 'house', 'tiny', 'fly', 'however', 'big', 'guy', 'house', 'light', 'part', 'nice', 'using', 'see', 'night', 'power', 'also', 'handy', 'run', 'run', 'usb', 'charging', 'also', 'work', 'battery', 'come', 'charge', 'time', 'took', 'couple', 'hour', 'charge', 'fully', 'last', 'hour', 'used', 'usually', 'charge', 'let', 'run', 'completely', 'yet', 'hang', 'center', 'tent', 'doe', 'make', 'good', 'light', 'center', 'tent', 'want', 'see', 'light', 'also', 'well', 'position', 'bug', 'handle', 'twist', 'tie', 'loop', 'bottom', 'line', 'using', 'camp', 'summer', 'nice', 'little', 'light', 'table', 'night', 'use', 'walking', 'night', 'around', 'camp', 'bug', 'tent', 'eye', 'mask', 'sleep', 'light', 'bright', 'sleep', 'rating', 'four', 'star', 'turn', 'bug', 'stop', 'update', 'rating', 'light', 'work', 'seems', 'supposed', 'enough', 'see', 'good', 'really']"

1040,5.0,Trust the brand- total quality!!,"After a failed attempt at an off brand set of ankle weights.. I felt it best to trust the “big guns” when it comes to athletics and sports equipment.. Ha! Adidas didn’t disappoint- they know what they’re doing and have perfected the art.. Duh!! (Shame on me for doubting there would be a difference!)<br /><br />Compared to others- these weights are leaps and bounds more compatible to the human body.. they are not just a ring of weights with a buckle, end of story! This set has been put to the test in its design and the cut.. Wow! This actually contours with the ankle or wrist- personally, I find it best fits the ankle! But, can definitely be used on either. Using a soft material this shows attention to detail in the cut.. NO sharp edges or corners to irritate the skin. Believe me- this makes all the difference. (with my cheaper set I had cotton stuffed in my sock to combat sharp edging.. which failed me btw and was so not practical!!)<br /><br />The interior sand or gel(?) used to create the weight is evenly disbursed which also is a necessity. Placement depends on muscles strengthen appropriately- and this does it’s job in spades. Note: if unsure which size weight to order.. keep in mind user activity and length of time! Trust me, even 2-3lb. seem light.. right up until 10min. into a run, workout, or even a walk- and you will feel it adding a difference! I chose 3lb. and find it compatible for those at an intermediate workout level.<br /><br />Definitely recommend and admit its worth the extra investment to purchase a set from a trusted athletic company- you won’t be disappointed!

1041,5.0,"Quality, taste, & smell is as expected. Rehydrates well, tastes good dry. Mix of chunks & powder","--->>>Cooked, freeze dried chicken in a #10 (ie ""number ten"") can. Just under 1 lb of chicken. Can eat as is, or rehydrate. Mix of chunks, shreds, and powder. Best use is as a compliment to a dish, rather than as the focus of a plate. Think chicken tacos, soups, casseroles.. stuff like that. Might be ok made into a chicken salad sandwich. Smells like chicken, tastes like chicken. Is on par with other freeze dried chicken. It is no worse than other brands, might be better than some I had. If price looks good to you, and you want a trusted brand, then this ReadyWise freeze dried chicken will be a welcome addition to your food supplies.<br /><br />I do not rate on price, if I did then I would be rating low. $120 is steep. Prices fluctuate, we all have different budgets, needs, preferences. And current market for emergency food is volatile. I am a bit of a prepper, and I do include emergency packaged products into my long-term storage. I am keenly aware of price fluctuations and that some brands are simply marked at a premium price. ReadyWise is definitely one of them, by far. Nearly double in some comparisons. A more budget friendly option is Augason. Just need to shop around. I can say that this is quality chicken, quality brand, and the extra may be worth it.  So with this review I will focus on quality, and include some ramblings regarding filling out your pantry and why, Things to think about.<br /><br />I really don't focus on ""emergency"" packed foods. I buy my usual canned/boxed/bagged foods a little at a time, and rotate. I stack my fridge and freezer. I should learn to can and prep my own foods better.  In more recent times I have been adding in emergency packed products but usually only when they are on sale.  Always been a bit of a ""prepper"", since I was a toddler it seems, haha. It has served me well through power outages, sicknesses, unemployment, and even bigger stuff like the pandemic, and now... *vaguely gestures around* everything else that is going on. Prices are all over the place, sometimes food isnt available (many times this year I have gone to a store and they have been 100% out of basic chicken, and I am not about to drive all over to find chicken, waste gas time money.. ). I've never been one to be without when anything has come up. I never did ""emergency food"" if only because I didn't have the budget. I would stick with typical foods and try to store them well. Well now I have a little more wiggle room in my budget, and with the on and off sales of long term storage (20+ years), I take advantage when I can. This ReadyWise is really expensive at $120 per can, AND it has a best buy date of only a few years out. It really should have at least 10 years, and upwards of 25. It is packed the same as other emergency food brands, so I would think that this too should be fine for the duration. UNLESS they mean once opened.. then yeh, I can understand that shorter date. Either way, its all fine by me (when stored under proper conditions food like this should last forever).<br /><br />I've been adding in emergency packed items to further shore up my options. Chicken is versatile, and I can share some with my dogs and cats if need be (don't forget to prep for them too!). I like buying the #10 cans and tucking them away. Forgetting about them. They stack well, have a uniform appearance, and if they are anything like other brands, the #10 cans should float. I don't live in a flood zone, but these should stand up to water, even with denting. Just remember, all food products are sold based on weight, not volume. Expect to see a half empty can on many foods. Most companies don't do different sized cans because of the preference for uniformity. I tend to see #10 cans, small buckets, large buckets, and the occasional barrel. They all stack.<br /><br />Does the term prepper freak you out? Everyone's SHTF scenario varies. Doesn't need to be doomsday. I have lived through enough and experience enough that I am always grateful for a little PROACTIVE thinking. Has gotten me through A LOT. It could be bad weather (tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms), could be illness (simple headache to viral and beyond), could be road trip gone wrong (you do keep supplies in your car too, right?!), could be unemployment, sky rocketing prices (yesterday's prices is money in my pocket today) or power outage, or lack of transportation, or oven/fridge/other appliance break down, lock downs, or bigger stuff like plagues, food shortages, supply chain issues, *cough WW3 cough*, etc. No matter the situation we all need some things to get by: we need food, water, shelter, some hygiene and medical stuff, and so on. You don't have to stack ""emergency supplies"" but you do need to stack shelf stable food items. I don't like to live by ""just in time inventory"". I prefer to have my working daily pantry, then have extra tucked away that I can pull from as needed. Can't get to the store for a few days, a week, a few weeks? I'm good.<br /><br />Buy a few extra things every single time you go to the store. Don't need to stockpile all at once. Little bit here and there adds up nicely. If you get to a spot that you feel comfortable and have the budget, then grab the ""emergency"" items like ReadyWise, Nutristore, Augason, etc offers. I like adding it in and just forgetting about it. It provides a good feeling (psychologically comforting) knowing that something is there if/when needed. Also works great as camping or hiking food (again if price is right). Looking for some practical gift giving ideas? I am a big fan of survival gear, food, tools. I'm known to give smoke detectors and batteries, fire extinguishers, rechargeable light bulbs, and for the extra special in my life-- emergency food. Ones that will recognize the importance.<br /><br />Anyway, all told.. I give 5 stars because the can arrived in perfect condition, arrived quickly, chicken smells and tastes as expected. It is exactly as it should be. Price is insane to me, but I knew the price when I ordered.",0,"['number', 'best', 'use', 'rather', 'think', 'stuff', 'like', 'might', 'made', 'smell', 'like', 'taste', 'like', 'brand', 'might', 'better', 'price', 'look', 'good', 'want', 'brand', 'addition', 'food', 'rate', 'price', 'rating', 'low', 'price', 'different', 'need', 'current', 'emergency', 'food', 'bit', 'include', 'emergency', 'product', 'long', 'storage', 'price', 'brand', 'simply', 'price', 'definitely', 'one', 'far', 'double', 'option', 'need', 'around', 'say', 'quality', 'quality', 'brand', 'extra', 'may', 'worth', 'review', 'quality', 'include', 'thing', 'think', 'really', 'emergency', 'food', 'buy', 'food', 'little', 'time', 'food', 'better', 'time', 'emergency', 'product', 'usually', 'always', 'bit', 'since', 'seems', 'well', 'power', 'even', 'bigger', 'stuff', 'like', 'around', 'everything', 'else', 'going', 'price', 'place', 'sometimes', 'food', 'available', 'many', 'time', 'year', 'store', 'basic', 'find', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'never', 'one', 'without', 'anything', 'come', 'never', 'emergency', 'food', 'stick', 'typical', 'food', 'try', 'store', 'well', 'well', 'little', 'room', 'long', 'storage', 'year', 'take', 'really', 'expensive', 'per', 'best', 'buy', 'year', 'really', 'least', 'year', 'emergency', 'food', 'brand', 'think', 'fine', 'unless', 'mean', 'opened', 'understand', 'either', 'way', 'fine', 'food', 'like', 'last', 'emergency', 'item', 'option', 'dog', 'need', 'like', 'buying', 'away', 'well', 'anything', 'like', 'brand', 'live', 'stand', 'water', 'even', 'remember', 'food', 'product', 'based', 'weight', 'expect', 'see', 'half', 'many', 'food', 'company', 'different', 'sized', 'see', 'small', 'large', 'doe', 'everyone', 'doe', 'need', 'enough', 'experience', 'enough', 'always', 'little', 'thinking', 'gotten', 'lot', 'bad', 'weather', 'ice', 'simple', 'road', 'trip', 'wrong', 'keep', 'car', 'right', 'price', 'price', 'money', 'pocket', 'today', 'power', 'lack', 'break', 'lock', 'bigger', 'stuff', 'like', 'food', 'chain', 'issue', 'etc', 'matter', 'need', 'thing', 'get', 'need', 'food', 'water', 'stuff', 'emergency', 'need', 'food', 'item', 'like', 'live', 'time', 'prefer', 'working', 'daily', 'extra', 'away', 'pull', 'needed', 'get', 'store', 'day', 'week', 'week', 'good', 'buy', 'extra', 'thing', 'every', 'single', 'time', 'store', 'need', 'little', 'bit', 'add', 'nicely', 'get', 'spot', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'emergency', 'item', 'like', 'etc', 'offer', 'like', 'provides', 'good', 'feeling', 'something', 'needed', 'also', 'work', 'great', 'camping', 'hiking', 'food', 'price', 'right', 'looking', 'gift', 'idea', 'big', 'fan', 'gear', 'food', 'tool', 'give', 'battery', 'fire', 'light', 'extra', 'life', 'emergency', 'food', 'one', 'anyway', 'give', 'star', 'arrived', 'perfect', 'arrived', 'quickly', 'smell', 'taste', 'expected', 'exactly', 'price', 'price', 'ordered']"

1059,4.0,soak and/or cook by itself before adding to other food to get successful rehydration,"Pointing out a few things brought up in reviews:<br /><br />1. This is DEHYDRATED zucchini, NOT freeze-dried. Very different methods, different results, different pricing. While Mother Earth does carry some freeze dried, they do not have freeze dried zucchini. Another way to tell? With freeze dried foods, they can be eaten as is (crunchy snack) or rehydrated. Where as with dehydrated foods, most all (except fruits, usually) will need to be rehydrated in order to consume them (too tough to eat). This will require soaking and/or cooking for a period of time. Can't just toss it in the dish you are making and expect it to cook up quickly. So for this, it says to simmer 1 part zucchini to 2 parts water for 10-30 minutes. This very well may take longer. I let it cook for no less than 30 minutes before adding it to what I ultimately want to have it be part of. Another way to get it started is to let soak, then follow up with a shorter simmer.<br /><br />2. 1/2 cup dried zucchini = 1 cup cooked zucchini. I made up 1/4 cup and it made a very good sized portion. See my pics.<br /><br />3. End result is NOT EVER going to be same as fresh. Stop that. Then stop blaming the company/brand. YOu will always be disappointed. Best thing to get if you cant get fresh or frozen is to find a company who makes freeze dried. Even then, you are expecting a lot from zucchini. This is similar to others, and there aren't many out there to choose from.<br /><br />4. Shelf life can be very very long, if not indefinite if stored under proper conditions. Freeze dried for sure, but dehydrated can last a very long time. Be sure to keep it in well sealed container, out of light and dampness. Maybe keep in freezer or further repackaged into mylar or vac sealed jar.<br /><br />5. Taste is neutral. Kind of like how zucchini can be. I could tell it was zucchini though! I found that with proper rehydration it worked well in adding bulk to tacos, and can always be added to soup. I see it as a nutritional item rather than a way to have a plate of zucchini. Nice way to bulk up meals, add vitamins and minerals, yet not have to rely on fresh (for various reasons). I noticed that the skins were more like late summer yellow squash/zucchini. Kinda reminded me of regular squash- like butternut skins.  Not tough but had more ""presence"" I shall say. DID not taste or feel like ""tree bark"" in any way.<br /><br />6. If planning on using it in zucchini bread, muffins, cookies, or sauces, I would recommend running it through the blender after it has been rehydrated. Make it more of a puree. This will impart flavor and decrease any tougher bits.<br /><br />7. Says processed and packaged in USA, but WHERE do they get their vegetables from?? That I havent seen, here or on their web page<br /><br />8. If you dont like this packaging, they also offer mylar bag style.<br /><br />OVERALL: I think it is fine, and it as expected. I love seeing it in my pantry knowing that I have a variety of dehydrated foods to use when I cant get fresh, or food is scarce, or food doesnt look good, or I cant afford it that day. Buy a little here and there and stock up those cupboards. Would like to know where the zucchini comes from?<br /><br />PS. I miss when we could comment and ask questions of other reviewers.

1060,5.0,No Help Needed,"If you're enjoying the outdoors on a solo trip, it's important to have a tent that you can set up by yourself. This tent goes up in less than five minutes with no help required. The tent is lightweight and can easily be attached to a backpack for carrying.

The wool wicks to help avoid rubbing and create sore spots + blisters at points of contact. Wool absorbs vs. disperses sweat into shoe etc. *It’s good to allow washed feet air exposure post using.

1087,4.0,A Different Use For This Senior Citizen,"Some folks my age are into aerobics, jogging, weight lifting, and the like. Me, I'm much more sedentary and have no inclinations toward even something as basic as step aerobics. Nope, I have a very different use for this exercise step, one that is important to me. My bathtub is on an 8"" riser making it unnecessarily harder to get in and out of. A physical therapist suggested I get an exercise step to make using the bathtub easier. That was an excellent idea and this step works well for that, with a few caveats.<br /><br />On the plus side, the step feels sturdy to stand on and doesn't slide around. The extra risers allow me to set it at the height that works best for me. A few minor things keep me from giving it a full five stars though. For one thing, this step is very long, making it a bit unwieldy in my smaller bathroom. For another thing there's no handle for easy lifting. Back in the day when I did work out in a gym, they would stack steps like these along a back wall when the aerobics classes were not in session. So the steps were being picked up and moved around a lot. A handle on the side would make that a little easier to do. Finally, some of the plastic under the step seems a bit cheap and brittle. I don't know how that will hold up under extended use. All in all though, this step is doing exactly what I needed it to do and for that I have to give it four stars.",0,"['age', 'weight', 'like', 'much', 'even', 'something', 'basic', 'step', 'different', 'use', 'exercise', 'step', 'one', 'important', 'making', 'get', 'physical', 'get', 'exercise', 'step', 'make', 'using', 'easier', 'excellent', 'idea', 'step', 'work', 'well', 'plus', 'side', 'step', 'feel', 'sturdy', 'stand', 'doe', 'slide', 'around', 'extra', 'allow', 'set', 'height', 'work', 'best', 'thing', 'keep', 'full', 'five', 'star', 'though', 'one', 'thing', 'step', 'long', 'making', 'bit', 'smaller', 'another', 'thing', 'handle', 'easy', 'back', 'day', 'work', 'gym', 'step', 'like', 'along', 'back', 'wall', 'step', 'around', 'lot', 'handle', 'side', 'make', 'little', 'easier', 'finally', 'plastic', 'step', 'seems', 'bit', 'cheap', 'know', 'hold', 'use', 'though', 'step', 'exactly', 'needed', 'give', 'four', 'star']"

You can add any small ice pack if you need to it remain colder,  as the insulation is not very thick, but will suffice for shorter trips.<br /><br />Attach this to the car seat, and if you have children,  it keeps drinks and snacks compartmentalized without floating all over the back seat.<br /><br />Great little helper....

1099,3.0,"It Chops, Cuts, and Pounds but Remember its Limitations","If you own a home, there are certain, basic tools you need for day to day functioning and care on the outside of your house. Most households already have things like lawn mowers, shears, shovel, etc., but other tools that you will need eventually are an ax and a saw. The Zippo Axesaw takes care of both in a single tool.<br /><br />Zippo Axesaw is an ax, saw, and mallet all in one and it’s ready to assist when you need to chop, cut, and hammer. The ax- or more accurately, the hatchet- is good for chopping small branches and it seems like it was made to last. The saw, which is the tool I use most, is good for pruning trees. It cuts through them with relative ease. The handling of the saw is not as comfortable as other hand/pruning saws I have used, but it’s still good enough for my needs.<br /><br />With the mallet, the uses are a little bit limited. The head of the mallet is made from plastic, so you have to be careful what you use it for. It cannot take the place of a metal hammer, so don’t use it for anything except light pounding of things like, say, the stakes for a tent. If you remember its limits, you should be okay.<br /><br />Having all three of these tools in one is a good idea and I generally like this tool for that reason. However, I will be the first to admit that my other stand- alone hand saws, axes, and mallets are better if I compared them each, one to one, with the corresponding tool in the Zippo Axesaw. With this tool, you sacrifice some of the performance for convenience. But again, as long as you don’t get carried away and try to use the hatchet to chop down a large tree, you should be fine.<br /><br />Every household needs the basic tools for outdoor care and the Zippo Axesaw is a good choice for many tasks. It’s nice to have all three tools in one device and they each perform at a satisfactory level. I’m not thrilled with the comfort of the handle when using the saw, but this tool is still good for my limited outdoor needs.",1,"['home', 'basic', 'tool', 'need', 'day', 'day', 'care', 'outside', 'house', 'already', 'thing', 'like', 'etc', 'tool', 'need', 'saw', 'take', 'care', 'single', 'tool', 'saw', 'one', 'ready', 'need', 'cut', 'good', 'small', 'seems', 'like', 'made', 'last', 'saw', 'tool', 'use', 'good', 'tree', 'cut', 'saw', 'comfortable', 'hand', 'saw', 'used', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'need', 'little', 'bit', 'head', 'made', 'plastic', 'careful', 'use', 'take', 'place', 'metal', 'use', 'anything', 'except', 'light', 'thing', 'like', 'say', 'stake', 'tent', 'remember', 'okay', 'three', 'tool', 'one', 'good', 'idea', 'like', 'tool', 'reason', 'however', 'first', 'stand', 'hand', 'saw', 'better', 'compared', 'one', 'one', 'tool', 'tool', 'long', 'get', 'away', 'try', 'use', 'large', 'tree', 'fine', 'every', 'need', 'basic', 'tool', 'care', 'good', 'choice', 'many', 'nice', 'three', 'tool', 'one', 'device', 'level', 'comfort', 'handle', 'using', 'saw', 'tool', 'still', 'good', 'need']"

1111,4.0,Decent Reel with Zero Documentation,"I am not especially skilled with baitcasting reels though I do use them on occasion. I hadn’t heard of this brand before and knew little about it; so far it is proving to be a reasonably decent reel though a complete lack of documentation would make figuring this reel out a complete nightmare without prior understanding of this type of reel.<br /><br />There are no instructions with this reel, at all. So, do not expect to find much help in the box.<br /><br />The basic operation is smooth and simple. Push the button, cast and start reeling. Of course, be careful to not let it spool too quickly or it will backlash just like any other baitcasting reel. The retrieve is smooth and the oscillator does a good job of spooling evenly.<br /><br />Drag is set via a star wheel next to the handle, as expected. It took a bit of fiddling to get it set the way I want it and it is set now to work properly. Line feed speed during casting and retrieve resistance are set via the tension adjustment knob, also close the handle. The magnetic brake system is set via a dial on the opposite side, and it has setting numbered 0-9.<br /><br />The main issue with this reel is the complete lack of documentation. As I use primarily spinning reels instead of baitcasters, I had to refamiliarize myself with how these reels work.

1175,4.0,"Nice, Warm Jacket","Although this is designated as a Boys' jacket, I got it for my daughter. I think they could have easily marketed it as a unisex jacket since it is a very basic, simple, and pragmatic design. We live in Northern Wisconsin so we know a good jacket when we see one. Colombia is always a trusted brand and this jacket does not disappoint.<br /><br />The only trick in picking a jacket online is getting the sizing right. My daughter is 9 and although I was confident this would fit, I also knew that I have a 6 year old waiting in the wings. I'm fairly sure that when my older daughter grows out of this the younger one will take it on (although sometimes hand-me-downs are inexplicably rejected). I got lucky with the sizing, it fit my 9 year old perfectly. I included some photos with a tape measure so that you can see how long the zipper and the arms are. I suggest measuring an article of clothing that you have in your home to compare.<br /><br />The zipper was 22 inches from the collar to the waist, and the arm was about 16 inches from the armpit to the wrist (note that the tape measure extends beyond the armpit in the photo). Also note that I measured the bottom of the sleeve not the top.<br /><br />I'm pleased with this jacket but I took off a star for two reasons. 1. I would have liked this jacket to have some reflective elements. I'm a little hesitant to let my girl run around in a black jacket because of visibility concerns. However, she is with me most of the time so I don't believe it will be a problem. 2. I would have preferred pockets that close with a zipper. This keeps snow out of them when you go out sledding, and it also makes sure that you don't lose whatever ""precious"" treasures your kids happen to pick up.

The company customer support says once it is exposed to water, they can no longer support the product and don't recommend riding it for safety concerns. Meanwhile, some of our e-scooters were accidentally left outside DURING THE SAME STORM for 2 days and still work fine. An unexpected sudden drizzle is a fact of living in the northeast. If it is not reasonable to expect it to survive some light rain, I can't recommend this product AT ALL. Save your money.<br /><br />Original review: My kids LOVED this when we got it. They would ride around the block taking turns between this and an our electric scooters.

And, when I’m looking for my ball, I usually find others that have been lost. So in a typical round, I play with a lot of different golf balls. Some feel harder or more stiff off the club, and others are more forgiving with a less harsh impact. These balls are closer to the latter. It is very satisfying to make solid contact with these balls. I can’t say if they fly further or shorter than other balls. Similarly, I don’t know if these have better or worse spin control. But a clean swing feels great, and the ball flies off the club.

The instructions tell you how to play the game, but we couldn't find anything about the scoring other than the winner is the first person to get to 21 without going over.

I'm reviewing a 6 person sized tent, and I have to admit it is TALLER than I expected. We used to own an Ozark Trail 7 person tent that was not as tall as this inside.<br />It took a little while to get it going because the poles are so long, but with some help it wasn't too difficult. I love that it is self standing, nothing needs to be staked down in order to stand (unlike our Ozark tents) however it is still recommended to stake it down to prevent shifting and help with stability. However, if on rocky terrain or otherwise unable to easily shove a stake into the ground, this will still stand. Heck, you can even use it indoors if you have enough space for it.<br />It thankfully didn't rain too much on our trip so I can't vouch for how water resistant it is, but it seems pretty good.<br />One thing to note- like all tents, when they say ""6 people"" they are talking about lying down side-by-side like sardines in a can. It comfortably fits 3-4 with some room for luggage bags on our trip, which seems about right.",0,"['note', 'review', 'different', 'tent', 'different', 'size', 'person', 'sized', 'tent', 'expected', 'used', 'trail', 'person', 'tent', 'tall', 'inside', 'took', 'little', 'get', 'going', 'pole', 'long', 'help', 'difficult', 'love', 'nothing', 'need', 'order', 'stand', 'tent', 'however', 'still', 'recommended', 'stake', 'help', 'however', 'otherwise', 'easily', 'stake', 'ground', 'still', 'stand', 'even', 'use', 'enough', 'space', 'rain', 'much', 'trip', 'water', 'resistant', 'seems', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'thing', 'note', 'like', 'tent', 'say', 'people', 'side', 'side', 'like', 'comfortably', 'fit', 'room', 'bag', 'trip', 'seems', 'right']"

We are having to hang it outside just because of the smell. (We had planned for it to hang in the garage, but that didn't work out, thanks to the smell. Side note: it is moveable.)<br />Second, it does not come with the hardware shown. You have to figure something else out. It comes with the chain attached to a large carabiner. The carabiner does not fit through the hole to hang it.<br />Third, the filling hole is humorously small. It comes with a nozzle to attach to your hose to make the tiny hole work. But they have bigger plugs in kiddie pools. It just seems so weird to me that they include a nozzle for your hose, but not the hardware to hang the thing by the chain they send.<br />Really, the only thing going for this is that it is very durable. The plastic is super thick. So, it has that going for it, I guess.

1279,5.0,O'Neill HEAT 4/3mm LFS vs O'neill EPIC 4/3mm GBS vs Hyperflex Voodoo 4/3mm LFS vs Quiksilver Syncro 5/4/3mm LFS!!!,"At 62 I have been a lifelong big wave surfer and a very strong long distance swimmer (2-3 miles per day 4-5 days/week). I am 5' 11'' tall, with a 31'' inseam, 38-40&#34; waist, 46-47&#34; chest, 52&#34; around my shoulders, and 34&#34; arms with only 13.5&#34; biceps. I gained a lot of weight last year so 3 months ago I hooked up a harness in my pool and lost 20 lbs. swimming 1-3 miles per day in a NeoSport XSpan 3/2mm 2XXL full wetsuit.  Now at 227 lbs I am aiming for about 205-210 lbs. by spring, but the water temp cooled to 68 degrees and the 3/2mm wetsuit was no longer sufficiently warm. Water was flushing in my neck and back quite a bit.  I first layered a 1.5mm neoprene shirt under my 3/2mm wetsuit and got more warmth and less flushing, but arm flexibility was compromised.<br />I decided to test the following 3 backzip wetsuits, and I really hoped the Hyperflex Voodoo would be my best choice for swimming in waters that might hit around 45 degrees;<br /><br />1.  Hyperflex Voodoo 4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br />2.  O'Neill Epic 4/3mm XXL (GBS)<br />3.  O'Neill HEAT 4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br />4.  Quiksilver Syncro 5/4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br /><br />1. Hyperflex Voodoo 4/3mm XXL (LFS) My first shock was that  the Voodoo was the hardest suit to put on by far (even over a thin lycra bodysuit) partly because of the non-slip fleece lining, but also because the arms were very tight on my skinny arms, and the suit was extremely tight around my shoulders. I had to have help pulling the floodgate over my head, and zipping the suit up.  I am surprised I did not feel terribly choked by the floodgate or by the wetsuit neck when zipped up. Even though the tightness in the shoulders was stretching the neck piece a little, the neck piece still remained comfortably snug.  Over all I felt like I was in a 5mm standard 50% flex neoprene wetsuit rather than a 100% stretch suit. This XXL was terribly restrictive of my shoulders and arms, and it felt like I feared a XXL-Short wetsuit might feel.  I knew I'd be warm in this suit even in 45-50 degree water, and I'd have very little if any water flushing, but I could not imagine swimming 1/2 mile in this suit even after wearing it for over an hour indoors because if the lack of flexibility in the arms and shoulders.<br /><br />2.  O'Neill Epic 4/3 mm XXL (GBS)<br />AND<br />3.  O'Neill HEAT 4/3mm XXL-short (LFS)<br /><br />The 2 O'neill suits both went on extremely easily, which shocked me, and both fit me absolutely perfectly even thought the HEAT was a 2XL-Short and the Epic just an XXL.  I purposely didn't stretch the Epic 4/3mm out when I put it on though it would have stretched out a bit in length in the legs if I needed it to. The HEAT fit me perfectly EVERYWHERE.  The Neoprene in both suits was absolutely buttery, and both felt far more flexible than the Voodoo 4/3mm or than a NeoSport Xspan 5mm had felt a month earlier.  The heat retention of the front panel in both suits was immediately evident.  The Liquid Fluid Seal over all the seams on the HEAT 4/3mm suit were totally stretchy, and the added back heat panels convinced me I would be significantly warmer in the Heat 4/3mm than in the Epic 4/3mm suit with GBS seams.  My only initial complaint with both O'neill suits was that the shape of the neck put a little pressure on the front of my throat - perhaps because my posture is not great and I stand with my head tilted forward a little (genetic trait) - but this issue became completely unnoticeable once I took the Heat 4/3mm and then the Epic 4/3mm into the water.<br /><br />4.  Quiksilver Syncro 5/4/3mm XXL (LFS) - For a cold water suit, this would have been my second choice behind the O'neill HEAT with LFS. It went on easily even with the back floodgate, and I was able to zip it up without help from my wife. The Neoprene felt absolutely wonderful and stretchy, the seams were Liquid-Fluid Sealed and not just GBS seams, and the suit felt totally comfortable once zipped up.  My arms and shoulders had easy and full range of motion and I knew I could swim miles warmly in this suit.  My only issue and reason for spending $70 more on the O'neill HEAT was that the QuikSilver Syncro 2XL was at least 3 inches too long for me in the legs because I have shorter legs and a longer torso.  The arms were also a little long for me, bulging a little around my biceps, but fitting snugly and sealing well at my wrists and all the way up my forearms. If I lose the 20 lbs. the O'neill HEAT XXLS will still fit me well, but the Quiksilver Syncro XXL would then become way too loose.<br /><br />My wife watched me try on and compare each suit, and since the O'neill HEAT 4/3mm obviously fit me the best and had the features I needed to swim long distances in cold water, after trying on the other suits I immediately made my decision and kept the O'neill HEAT 4/3mm suit on.  I threw on some 5mm NeoSport booties, donned a swim cap and 3mm Neosport gloves, stepped down into a pool of 58 degree water (not feeling the slightest chill), hooked myself into the swimming harness and immediately went face first into the water to swim a mile.  Only my cheeks were a little chilled at first. I felt NO water getting in through the neck, or the seams of my O'neill HEAT wetsuit. I felt No Chill at all !!!

The plastic needle kept falling out, and the ball, of course, lost air. Using his foot was out of the question. He then just used his hands to pump with the provided plastic pump.

But I assembled anyway and planned to contact the manufacturer.. After a few hours of stress, I got it together and realized it's not centered. The entire frame is off center from the seat (not something I can control - that part is already assembled) so I can't use the desk and can't fold it up.

The seat only adjusts up and down, it doesn't adjust front to back - I had to unscrew the bolts to try and do that, but it didn't help.<br /><br />Desk does not go low enough, and if you raise the seat, you can't reach the pedals. The only compromise is tilting the desk all the way toward you, which makes it even more painful on your wrists and arms.  Getting on or off the bike is very tricky - the handlebars are right there, so I kept banging my leg, it was very awkward.

The purple isn't super dark but it isn't lavender either so I am fine with it.<br /><br />I am returning one blanket for a replacement for a different reason though.

1381,2.0,Hurts my tush. Had to remove.,"I've been wanting a Brooks saddle for a few years now and was excited when I was given a chance to try this non-leather variant (though leather would've been much preferred, yet beggars can't be choosers). I measured my sit bones and, according to my home tests and several online charts, the C17 should be right in my ballpark.<br /><br />I put it on my Trek 7.1 hybrid bike. I bike about two to three times a week during the warmer months here in Chicago and used to have a comfort seat that eventually I found much too large for when I like to ride hard and fast.<br />I didn't know what made the C17 different from the B17 at first, but after a wee bit of research I read that, because it's made of rubber, the C17 is easier to ""break in"" compared to other Brooks saddles.<br /><br />That being said, I found this to be much more *uncomfortable* than the stock seat my Trek 7.1 came with. After about two weeks' worth of riding, I found absolutely no comfort on my rear whatsoever. I could feel the seat's metal posts bearing roughly into my rear, and the breaking-in period nearly was non-existent. I'm not sure whether this is the case for all Brooks saddles or this one (or even if I've received a singularly errant model), but the seat really provides zero comfort for me.<br /><br />I like to (shamefully) boast that I have a modest tush. My rear doth extend toward the upper edge, many thanks to the number of squats I do per week. And so I feel I have an appropriately muscled bottom. But as I've never asked experts I cannot fully commit to those claims, but still I feel that the Brooks saddle causes me more discomfort than another. I've since been using a Selle saddle that costs about half the price and is far more comfortable.",1,"['saddle', 'year', 'excited', 'given', 'chance', 'try', 'non', 'though', 'much', 'yet', 'sit', 'home', 'test', 'several', 'online', 'right', 'put', 'bike', 'bike', 'two', 'three', 'time', 'week', 'month', 'used', 'comfort', 'seat', 'found', 'much', 'large', 'like', 'ride', 'hard', 'fast', 'know', 'made', 'different', 'first', 'bit', 'read', 'made', 'rubber', 'easier', 'break', 'compared', 'saddle', 'said', 'found', 'much', 'uncomfortable', 'seat', 'came', 'two', 'week', 'worth', 'riding', 'found', 'absolutely', 'comfort', 'rear', 'feel', 'seat', 'metal', 'post', 'rear', 'non', 'sure', 'case', 'saddle', 'one', 'even', 'received', 'model', 'seat', 'really', 'provides', 'comfort', 'like', 'rear', 'upper', 'edge', 'many', 'thanks', 'number', 'per', 'week', 'feel', 'bottom', 'never', 'fully', 'still', 'feel', 'saddle', 'cause', 'another', 'since', 'using', 'saddle', 'cost', 'half', 'price', 'far', 'comfortable']"

1403,4.0,"Go bigger for most options, Besides camping, Good for heat containment in power outage","I have the ""3-4"" person option. I chose this after carefully considering the dimensions. In my experience, I get  3 person tents for just myself. I am tall and wide, and want room to move, and have space for gear. The difference between their 2 person tent and ""3-4"" person tent is not much in one direction, but it adds quite a bit of space in another. So no matter what, if you have 2 people and get the two people tent you will be shoulder to shoulder, and if you 3 people for a 3 person tent, you will be shoulder to shoulder. So where does a 4th person go? Along the 3 peoples feet (or head). I wont be person #4. haha<br />SIZE :<br />2 people (82.67"" X 59.05"" X 47.24"")<br />4 people (86.67"" X 82.67"" X 59.05"" )<br /><br />That being said, I got the 3-4 person tent for use for myself and my 2 large labs. Not necessarily for camping (though will do for that), but as a prep item in case the electric goes out or heat goes out. Sleeping can be much more comfortable (and survivable) if the space around you is reduced. So furnace out in a blizzard? House getting real cold? Get layered up, set up a tent INSIDE the house (or even on the bed, or make a layered bed roll), and your body heat will be contained. Add a handful of cats and a couple of big labs, and we have a toasty sweat lodge, haha. Not sure where my husband will sleep. He can have a bivvy on other side of room, haha.<br /><br />Internal hook for hanging a light. Bag is big enough to be able to get the tent back inside.<br /><br />I happen to already have a couple of tents of this size, but I have had them for like 20 years and I havent used them in about 10 years.. so I wanted to ""freshen up"" my preps. Had a little sticker shock, but this seamed to be reasonable price for the size I chose. The two person appears doable if for 1 person and some gear, or a couple of slim people who like each other a lot. The 3/4 person is more for me and my preferences. I keep a tent in my car. I have kept one as an emergency item since I first began driving as a teen. Now in my 40s, it is just a habit. I can sleep in my car, but I am a big fan of options. Many times I went camping on the fly because I had everything I needed in my trunk. Still do. Why not?<br /><br />4 stars because everything looks good. I havent truly put it through its paces yet.

1408,4.0,Turn an Ordinary Table into Instant Fun,"Sportcraft Anywhere Table Tennis set is a handy way to enjoy some instant, spur of the moment fun. With this set, you don't need to worry about pulling out the large tennis table stored in the garage and finding a place to set it up. With Sportcraft Anywhere Table Tennis set, most any table can be quickly turned into a tennis table for immediate fun and entertainment.<br /><br />This set consists of everything you need to play table tennis, except for the table, of course. All you do it anchor the two posts to a table, remove the balls and paddles, and the game is on. The posts can be attached to the edges of any table up to six feet, three inches in width and no more than 1.75 inches in thickness. The net itself is spring- mounted and the bases of the posts are rubberized to protect the table surface beneath.<br /><br />We have multiple tables in my house and the one we tend to use for this game is our game room table. It is a little small (a larger, closer to regulation size table would be better), but the posts fit and it works just fine for my family, which includes two children who are still too young to play on a lager table anyway. One of my other tables isn't usable for this purpose because its edges are too thick, but I have two tables in the house that work just fine and considering that a table can be up to 1.75 inches in thickness and fit the posts, most households will likely have a table that works for this purpose.<br /><br />This set comes complete with a pair of paddles and three balls. You need to keep track of the balls- they are small and will get lost if you're not careful. The paddles are not the greatest quality, but one has to remember that this set is intended more for the casual table tennis player. It isn't meant for the serious competitor and will likely not suffice for that purpose.<br /><br />A good, physical, indoor game makes a nice change of pace from the usual board game and for this reason, I am glad I received the Sportcraft Anywhere Table Tennis set. It quickly turns most any table into a tennis table, saving families the space problems and expense of buying a regular table tennis set.",0,"['anywhere', 'table', 'set', 'handy', 'way', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'set', 'need', 'worry', 'large', 'table', 'garage', 'place', 'set', 'anywhere', 'table', 'set', 'table', 'quickly', 'turned', 'table', 'fun', 'set', 'everything', 'need', 'play', 'table', 'except', 'table', 'course', 'two', 'post', 'table', 'remove', 'ball', 'paddle', 'game', 'post', 'attached', 'edge', 'table', 'six', 'foot', 'three', 'inch', 'inch', 'thickness', 'net', 'spring', 'base', 'post', 'protect', 'table', 'surface', 'multiple', 'table', 'house', 'one', 'use', 'game', 'game', 'room', 'table', 'little', 'small', 'larger', 'size', 'table', 'better', 'post', 'fit', 'work', 'fine', 'family', 'two', 'child', 'still', 'play', 'table', 'anyway', 'one', 'table', 'purpose', 'edge', 'thick', 'two', 'table', 'house', 'work', 'fine', 'table', 'inch', 'thickness', 'fit', 'post', 'likely', 'table', 'work', 'purpose', 'set', 'come', 'complete', 'pair', 'paddle', 'three', 'ball', 'need', 'keep', 'track', 'ball', 'small', 'get', 'lost', 'careful', 'paddle', 'quality', 'one', 'remember', 'set', 'intended', 'table', 'serious', 'likely', 'purpose', 'good', 'physical', 'game', 'make', 'nice', 'change', 'board', 'game', 'reason', 'glad', 'received', 'anywhere', 'table', 'set', 'quickly', 'turn', 'table', 'table', 'family', 'space', 'problem', 'buying', 'regular', 'table', 'set']"

These stretch a lot and in a lot of directions. I have a lot of leggings, varying from $5 Walmart ones to $100 lululemon ones. And these seem reasonable for $30. They fit great in all the right places and the seams all look very durable with no loose stitching. The material has a great thickness to it and doesn’t feel cheap at all.

We all had a ball taking on a task at mealtime- cutting and chopping was a fav. (my pandemic silver lining..!!) this set allowed x1 knife for each- and my kiddos were smitten.<br /><br />The intricate detail is there start/finish- hand stitch sheathes with snap closure are perfectly fit to their tiny silver blades.. all in a different cut these have a laser etched design which is impressive.. and their detailed handles just brings it all home.  Perfect for any to keep together as a set and the little tin provided is ideal.. I gifted x1 to ea. of my x4 kiddos  to commemorate our  “cooking quarantine” and trust me, the joy was all theirs.<br /><br />Easy to connect on one’s key ring and even come in handy in the most awkward of times.. box cutter, string snipper, make shift flat edge tightener, etc. **Just be sure these are not on ones person if flying as they may not pass TSA guidelines!! We lucked out and had time to take it off daughters backpack and return to our driver!!**<br /><br />Overall, a solid $15 spent.. for a perfect little replicated set of knives to make any enthusiast happy!

1433,4.0,Not a good gift for a Toy Drive,"At this time of year, there are holiday Toy Drives at churches, banks, fire stations, police stations -- everywhere! The toys need to be new, unwrapped, and suitable for children or teens.  The problem with this Indoor Basketball Hoop is that it was mailed to me in the toy package itself, not in a shipping box.  The seller pasted all kinds of shipping labels on it and taped the corners with transparent mailing tape.<br /><br />It took me the better part of an hour to clean-up the box to get all of the shipping labels and postage labels removed.  The box itself was plain and black and, except for the logo and a few guidelines about the suggested age of the players, gave no indication of the contents.<br /><br />It would be impossible for volunteers to know what to do with this box.  The outside of the box, now all damaged from removing the shipping labels, had no advertising or illustrations.<br /><br />I opened the box to make sure that all of the contents were intact.  The instructions seemed to show the hoop upside down on the door, but it didn't matter because the contents were very nice, easy to assemble by simply inserting the items into their obvious slots, colorful, and nicely made.<br /><br />I ended-up gifting this purchase to a nine-year-old niece and decided to buy something else for the Toy Drive -- something with a clearly marked toy that would arrive in shrink-wrapped packaging inside the shipping box, as mailed items usually do, and create a fun gift.",0,"['time', 'year', 'toy', 'fire', 'toy', 'need', 'new', 'child', 'problem', 'hoop', 'toy', 'package', 'shipping', 'box', 'seller', 'kind', 'shipping', 'tape', 'took', 'better', 'part', 'hour', 'clean', 'box', 'get', 'shipping', 'box', 'black', 'except', 'logo', 'age', 'gave', 'know', 'box', 'outside', 'box', 'shipping', 'opened', 'box', 'make', 'sure', 'instruction', 'seemed', 'show', 'hoop', 'door', 'matter', 'nice', 'easy', 'assemble', 'simply', 'item', 'nicely', 'made', 'ended', 'purchase', 'year', 'old', 'decided', 'buy', 'something', 'else', 'toy', 'something', 'toy', 'inside', 'shipping', 'box', 'item', 'usually', 'fun', 'gift']"

It rolls down to a remarkably small size and compresses so it is good for hiking and paddling. The zipper was amazingly smooth the first three or four times up and down, but then it caught a loose thread and bound.  Once freed it was smooth again, but worried about fraying now.  I did not see any other sign of loose strings and it seems to be well made. for the price, this is a very good sleeping bag.<br /><br />1/23 Now having these bags for a couple of years, I can vouch that they have held up well for a good number of sleepovers and some car camping.

It certainly suits my personality and because I rarely play golf, it can't hurt to keep my clubs covered with something really nice. While I was inspecting the Weimaraner cover, I noted that it was very well made and seemed quite sturdy. The material is thick and soft and the interior is lined with a really high quality sherpa type soft material so it won't scratch your expensive clubs when in use.<br /><br />I set this down on the kitchen table and went to retrieve my clubs from the garage. When I returned, the dog cover was gone - vanished. I searched for 10 minutes until my husband tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to the living room ottoman. Our giant Plott Hound, Traveler, had absconded with the Weimaraner head cover and claimed it as his own. I gently took it back and he gently put one paw on my arm and his teeth on the nose of the cover. Bottom line here is that this thing now belongs to Traveler and my golf clubs are on their own.

1449,4.0,Now I see how a butterfly feels in a cocoon.,"The Therm-a-rest Saros 20 degree sleeping bag is perfect for young kids/teens going to summer camp or for those who enjoy camping out. You will feel snug as a bug! This sleeping bag is shaped like a mummy’s sarcophagus so when you are in it, you feel swaddled like a baby. Some may not like this, because it does feel a little restrictive, but I don’t mind. Usually, with traditional sleeping bags, I find myself pulling at the top, but with this design and shape, that is no longer necessary. It curves around or molds to my head. In other words, it fits tightly around the head and face. This sleeping bag is extremely light and folds up well in the accompanying drawstring bag. I like that you have the option of attaching it to a “sleeping pad” (which is not included), which will make for an even more comfortable sleep.  It’s attractive. Which is always a plus when camping. The one I received is a vibrant green, with gray, black and neon green accents. It is water resistant which is a wonderful feature when camping. The only thing that I will warn you about is the sizing. If you are purchasing this bag, select the size wisely. Because this isn’t the traditional shape of a sleeping bag, you can’t afford not to get the right size. I received this sleeping bag in “regular” which was perfect for me because I am 5’4 (and you don’t need to know my weight), but my son, who is 16 and 6’3 (160lbs), found it to be a little tight. He could fit inside, but said he would have preferred a bigger size (i.e., the long). So, just remember when ordering that this is a more compact/restrictive sleeping bag, so to be safe, order it a little bigger. Overall, I think that this is a great sleeping bag for campers or for just lounging on the couch (who can’t use something warm and lightweight while they binge watch some TV). It will keep them warm and snug. 4 stars.",0,"['rest', 'degree', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'perfect', 'kid', 'going', 'summer', 'camp', 'enjoy', 'camping', 'feel', 'snug', 'bug', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'like', 'feel', 'like', 'may', 'like', 'doe', 'feel', 'little', 'mind', 'usually', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'find', 'top', 'design', 'shape', 'longer', 'around', 'head', 'fit', 'around', 'head', 'face', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'extremely', 'light', 'fold', 'well', 'bag', 'like', 'option', 'sleeping', 'pad', 'included', 'make', 'even', 'comfortable', 'sleep', 'always', 'plus', 'camping', 'one', 'received', 'green', 'black', 'green', 'water', 'resistant', 'wonderful', 'feature', 'camping', 'thing', 'sizing', 'bag', 'size', 'isn', 'shape', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'get', 'right', 'size', 'received', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'regular', 'perfect', 'need', 'know', 'weight', 'son', 'found', 'little', 'tight', 'fit', 'inside', 'said', 'bigger', 'size', 'long', 'remember', 'compact', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'safe', 'order', 'little', 'bigger', 'overall', 'think', 'great', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'use', 'something', 'warm', 'lightweight', 'watch', 'keep', 'warm', 'snug', 'star']"

1458,3.0,"A very interesting concept, with some caveats","I love the concept of these- When a water ""bottle"" isn't a bottle at all, and you can flatten it and/or roll it up when finished instead of carrying around an empty water bottle all day!  Once it is full, you can even stand it up like a proper bottle and it comes with a grommet hole for attaching to things like a bike, bag, etc.<br />My concern however is that due to the nature of the bag-like construction, water gets easily trapped inside it after use. For example, I used these and then washed it out and left it to dry in my kitchen. I noticed later that day that in some places the plastic had been trapping pockets of water inside and not drying. So I blew air into it to inflate it, and left it upside down to dry (some water immediately dripped out upon doing that). Two days later, there is still some moisture inside, as you can see in the attached photo. I'm concerned that if stored for a long time like this, you might find mold growing in the ""bottle"". It seems great to take along for a camping trip where you might not want to carry around empty bottles and then refill this pouch when you can, but I'm not sure I'd trust it for long term usage.

1469,5.0,Great addition for anyone with a pool..!!,"There always seems to be one in the swim crowd lucky enough to have goggles.. this of course sets off a chain reaction for other swimmers wanting a pair too!! Well, here in lies salvation- a universal set of 6 for $32.. (just over $5 a pair!) Let me tell you- for the quality you’ll receive you wont find a better deal.. and trust me I’ve looked!!<br /><br />Although not smaller size for younger children they will work nicely for adolescence and up..we used w/ x4 adults and an 8+10yr old. Fit was adjustable and the seal around goggles was form fitting to varied shape/size faces (we had x1 adult struggle to get good fit-but I blame user error.. ha! you know the type!!)<br /><br />If you leave sealed and in place- these easily stay a solid “95% fog free!” We found the more you lift on/off- the more prone to fog they are.. mostly by user breathing directly up into lenses! In a game of hiding coins on pool bottom- we lasted almost an hr. without any leaks.. pretty AMAZING!! Especially if you think of $ spent for the entire set.<br />Silicone band is easy to adjust sizing and avoid painful pressure in fit.. band over bridge of nose keeps goggles from twisting. But, cherry on top is earplugs for those who hate getting water trapped in ears- the “silicone screw” twists into ear canal and seals out h2o- these dongle on side and yes! They’re optional.. can be removed if desired.<br /><br />Great to have on hand for next pool event- trust me, you’ll be the “kool-aid mom” that everyone loves!!

1487,3.0,Smooth Operation; Bail Does not Close on Retrieve,"Note: There are multiple products attached to this listing. I am specifically writing this review for the Size 85 spinning reel.<br /><br />One of my favorite pastimes is fishing, and my brothers and I have made a point of scheduling an annual gathering to go fishing. Usually, that means a saltwater trip, and when we have not rented a charter we have had to provide our own gear. I do have a large saltwater reel that has served me reasonably well but it is not particularly good (I’d call it sufficient). My experience with Quantum has been freshwater spinning reels, so I know it’s a decent brand but I hadn’t worked with their saltwater-ready reels at all before this one. This is a brute of a reel and is a smooth operator, though I have encountered what I consider to be a serious issue.<br /><br />Please note, there are several different sizes of this reel. If you are looking to do freshwater fishing in a quiet pond or lake, the 85 is a beast that is probably more reel than you need. Consider one of the other choices. However, for going after saltwater fish, either from a pier or from the shore, this is a good choice if you expect to catch anything of good size.<br /><br />This reel is solid and has a smooth retrieve and zero-reverse clutch that doesn’t give even a little bit. The drag is easy to set and seems to work very well, though I do wish it was a bit louder.<br /><br />I’ve encountered on issue with this reel and I think I have a defective one. The bail does not close by itself when I start cranking, I have to manually flip it myself to lock it back into retrieve mode. I cannot tell if I have a bad unit or if this is a design decision. Regardless, it is different and unexpected behavior than I have had with every other spinning reel, whether saltwater or freshwater. I plan to reach out to Quantum to determine if this is right or not. Though it doesn’t render the reel unusable, it does make it more work than it needs to be.<br /><br />I like this reel, but I hesitate to rate it higher because of the bail issue I am seeing. Once I contact Quantum and determine the reason, I will return here and provide an update. If the bail closed as expected, this would be an easy 5-star product.",1,"['note', 'multiple', 'product', 'attached', 'review', 'size', 'reel', 'one', 'favorite', 'fishing', 'made', 'point', 'fishing', 'usually', 'mean', 'trip', 'provide', 'gear', 'large', 'reel', 'well', 'good', 'experience', 'reel', 'know', 'decent', 'brand', 'worked', 'ready', 'reel', 'one', 'reel', 'smooth', 'though', 'consider', 'serious', 'issue', 'please', 'note', 'several', 'different', 'size', 'reel', 'looking', 'fishing', 'probably', 'reel', 'need', 'consider', 'one', 'choice', 'however', 'going', 'fish', 'either', 'good', 'choice', 'expect', 'catch', 'anything', 'good', 'size', 'reel', 'solid', 'smooth', 'doesn', 'give', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'easy', 'set', 'seems', 'work', 'well', 'though', 'wish', 'bit', 'issue', 'reel', 'think', 'one', 'doe', 'close', 'start', 'lock', 'back', 'mode', 'tell', 'bad', 'unit', 'design', 'decision', 'different', 'every', 'reel', 'plan', 'reach', 'right', 'though', 'doesn', 'reel', 'doe', 'make', 'work', 'need', 'like', 'reel', 'rate', 'higher', 'issue', 'contact', 'reason', 'return', 'provide', 'update', 'closed', 'expected', 'easy', 'star', 'product']"

1491,4.0,Interesting Emergency/Survival Kit,"A good first aid kit is a good thing to keep in the car when traveling and I selected this kit to keep in one of the vehicles because all of us are road warriors these days. Of course, the hope is that it is never needed, but when one is needed it's an invaluable resource. This is an interesting kit, and it has some pluses and minuses.<br /><br />This is a small kit that fits nicely under a seat, in a seat pocket, or in a center console. Finding a place for it in a car or truck should be no issue at all.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in this kit. It has a lot of the typical first aid items - bandages, gauze, cotton swabs, anticeptic wipes, and even a foil emergency blanket. There's some really odd things in here too - a flint, a compass, a whistle and a multi-tool are the stand-outs. This is not a typical first-aid kit but is also a basic survival kit.<br /><br />The multi-tool is the standout in the whole kit and is worth the cost of the whole kit. It seems to be made fairly well, it is heavier than some of the cheaper ones I have seen and used and it has the basic tools you'd expect - pliers, a knife, screwdriver, etc. It includes a set of bits as well.<br /><br />The compass is relatively cheap but it does work.<br /><br />The remainder of the components in this kit are farily nondescript. All will work in an emergency capacity.<br /><br />As a first aid kit this isn't so bad. However, this thing tries to be a survival kit as well, and on that basis there's an important omission - there's no flashlight in this kit. Even a small $5 flashlight would make this kit more complete and capable.<br /><br />This certainly isn't a bad kit, but it tries to be two different things and as a survival kit it comes up a little short. This will serve well for a traveling family and in a pinch it will make a decent emergency kit, but I would not rely on it as a sole source.",0,"['good', 'first', 'aid', 'kit', 'good', 'thing', 'keep', 'car', 'kit', 'keep', 'one', 'road', 'day', 'course', 'hope', 'never', 'needed', 'one', 'needed', 'kit', 'plus', 'small', 'kit', 'fit', 'nicely', 'seat', 'seat', 'pocket', 'center', 'place', 'car', 'issue', 'lot', 'going', 'kit', 'lot', 'typical', 'first', 'aid', 'item', 'even', 'emergency', 'blanket', 'really', 'thing', 'whistle', 'tool', 'stand', 'typical', 'first', 'aid', 'kit', 'also', 'basic', 'kit', 'tool', 'whole', 'kit', 'worth', 'cost', 'whole', 'kit', 'seems', 'made', 'fairly', 'well', 'heavier', 'cheaper', 'one', 'seen', 'used', 'basic', 'tool', 'expect', 'knife', 'etc', 'set', 'bit', 'well', 'cheap', 'doe', 'work', 'kit', 'work', 'emergency', 'first', 'aid', 'kit', 'bad', 'however', 'thing', 'try', 'kit', 'well', 'important', 'flashlight', 'kit', 'even', 'small', 'flashlight', 'make', 'kit', 'complete', 'certainly', 'bad', 'kit', 'try', 'two', 'different', 'thing', 'kit', 'come', 'little', 'short', 'well', 'family', 'make', 'decent', 'emergency', 'kit']"

1505,4.0,"Easy to assemble, but some bizarre design choices","[[VIDEOID:64c8658b81382127e4a89d8e490ca985]] My kids love camping, so when we got this tent they were excited to try popping it up in our playroom first before we take it out. Before I go any further, I want to point out that to its' credit, this tent was easy enough for a couple of girls aged 9 and 11 to figure it out themselves.<br />That being said, I'm glad we did it at home first because I noticed at least one weird design flaw: The outer door cover is REALLY difficult to close from the inside. You see, like many tents, the doors are two layers: an outer rain flap and an inner bug-net window screen. bug net opens in the middle with a zipper, and the outer later opens on the sides (attached from the top, zipper around the perimeter).<br />This is odd because it seems like it is only designed to be closed from the outside like this! The zipper for the outer flap has an inside handle, but if the bug screen is closed, you can't reach it. I suppose you could open the bug screen all the way in order to get to the zipper, but it seems a whole lot easier to close and open both from the outside than the inside, which I wasn't expecting.<br />I'm not sure how I feel about that, I suppose it will still do the job out at a campsite, but it just feels poorly thought out.",0,"['videoid', 'kid', 'love', 'camping', 'got', 'tent', 'excited', 'try', 'first', 'take', 'want', 'point', 'tent', 'easy', 'enough', 'couple', 'figure', 'said', 'glad', 'home', 'first', 'noticed', 'least', 'one', 'weird', 'design', 'flaw', 'door', 'cover', 'really', 'difficult', 'close', 'inside', 'see', 'like', 'many', 'tent', 'door', 'two', 'rain', 'bug', 'net', 'window', 'screen', 'bug', 'net', 'open', 'middle', 'zipper', 'later', 'open', 'side', 'attached', 'top', 'zipper', 'around', 'seems', 'like', 'designed', 'closed', 'outside', 'like', 'zipper', 'inside', 'handle', 'bug', 'screen', 'closed', 'reach', 'open', 'bug', 'screen', 'way', 'order', 'get', 'zipper', 'seems', 'whole', 'lot', 'easier', 'close', 'open', 'outside', 'inside', 'expecting', 'sure', 'feel', 'still', 'job', 'feel', 'thought']"

1513,1.0,NO NO NO!,"SO ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!<br />I have been doing yoga for about 3 years, and I bought this for my boyfriend as a way of getting him to do yoga with me. This is not the kit for him or anyone else.<br /><br />This is NOT even a kit for beginners --- Beginners: Stay away from this mat and get a mat that does NOT come from a kit (Gaiam is fine; just not this one).<br /><br />The Mat: This mat is so ridiculously thin. Some are the super expensive mats are thin too, but they are made of really high-quality material and can give surprising cushioning. This is NOT one of them. This mat was so thin and looked like it could rip very easily. It won't last you long--you would want to get a new mat very quickly (assuming that this mat doesn't put beginners off yoga altogether, if it makes them think yoga is too painful on the floor), so it isn't worth any &#34;savings&#34;.<br /><br />The blocks: These blocks are not yoga blocks. They are way too thin, and you would probably wobble if trying to use them for support.<br /><br />The strap: It's a strap. You could easily substitute with the tie from a bathrobe. Whatever.<br /><br />The CD: Do you know how many yoga videos there are free on youtube? And other video streaming services? I never looked at this.<br /><br />I returned this product immediately, and instead bought the Gaiam Plum/Jam 5mm Yoga Mat for him. What a WORLD of difference!<br /><br />(For people who are more serious about yoga and want to have a mat that is excellent and lasts a long time, if not a lifetime, go for a Manduka mat or the Lululemon mat. The Manduka is slippy for the first couple of weeks as you break it in, which is very frustrating, but this mat will last you a lifetime...they even have lifetime guarantee.

1525,5.0,IN DEPTH REVIEW For Those Interested To Know About This Tent (FINALLY A Sturdy Tent With METAL Poles),"(WARNING- This is an IN DEPTH review for those serious about making buying decisions.  If you prefer a quick summary, see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE<br />----------------<br />My family has been very enthusiastic about tent camping for quite some time.  We have had a variety of tents over time, but one of our favorites was a Eureka one we had that was vintage.  It was one of the last ones made in the US from what we understand and it lasted for a long time even past us getting it used.  The design was perfect for the family and it was sturdy too.  Had my husband not refused to stake it down one night insisting we would not get any wind, we would probably still have it.  We got wind that night- so much that it pinned him against the building it blew him up against.  He never refused again.<br /><br />Our most recent tent experience has been horrible.  We got a fantastic Coleman tent- great design- but the poles snapped the second time we used it- no wind, no bad weather- just snapped.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TENT LIKE?<br />This tent is the most like the design of the Eureka we had some years ago that we have seen yet.  I am going to break this down into sections about this tent so it is easier to work through to find what you want to know.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />The fabric in this tent is as nice or nicer than the Colemans that we have had.  It is gray, white, and teal.  The screen is no-see-um netting but is thin- care needs to be taken to be sure it does not tear.<br /><br />POLES<br />The poles are fantastic- best feature of this tent.  The side poles are heavy steel with steel core shock cords in the poles.  There are several shock corded fiberglass poles in this set.  These poles go on top for a curved roof and also for the curved fly.<br /><br />CONNECTORS<br />The connectors are all plastic, but quite sturdy- better than some of Coleman.  Over time, I am not sure how they will hold up, but they are nice and sturdy.<br /><br />STAKES<br />The stakes are about 8 inches long with a curved hook on top.  They are about 1/4 inch thick straight rounded steel stakes- not something you will want to use in high winds or soil that is extremely wet or sandy.  If you want something a little substantial or longer, you will have to purchase them.  There are 13 stakes that come with this- for the tent and the cords that hold the tent stable.<br /><br />WINDOWS<br />There is screen on the ceiling of the tent for a lot of circulation.  It breathes nicely.  The windows are also nice and large.  However, one of my problems with this tent is that there are no ties for the windows to roll them up.  They have to hang loose.  I am not fond of that and wish they would have put ties or clips on them.<br /><br />DOOR<br />There is a tie back for the door, but not the window in the door.  The door is plenty roomy and opens nicely.  It is not too far above the ground and opens with a nice zipper.  If it were reinforced like some of the Coleman tents (with a little curved fiberglass pole around the edge and velcro to shut it as you go in and out) it would be perfect.  Still it is pretty nice.<br /><br />STAND UP ROOM<br />Everyone in the family has plenty of room to stand up straight including our 6 ft 3in member of the family.<br /><br />SET UP<br />The set up of the tent is not difficult but it does take at least two people.  If this is going to be put up in any kind of breeze, you will need three or four people to hold the tent from blowing away while you try to get it set up and staked down.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />The instructions are a nylon label sewn into the case.  They are not particularly detailed when it comes to the extras like how to put the hanging storage in the tent.  It is adequate for how to put up the tent, however, not a lot of detail beyond that.<br /><br />CASE<br />Many times a tent comes in a very tiny case that does not store the tent once you have used it because the tent is often too big once it is rolled back up again.  In this case, with some work, the case does fit the tent without too much struggle.  It has a dual zipper.  The tent comes with tiny ties in it that should be more substantial to help put the tent back.<br /><br />FLY<br />The fly goes on well and does clip into place nicely.<br /><br />WIND<br />Although this is difficult to put up in the wind (ask me how I know), once it is up and staked down with the lines and stakes and everything clipped as it should be, this tent is quite nice even in the wind.  It stays pretty well although I would not expect it to make it through a very severe wind storm which most tents will not.  For the usual weather, it seems to do fine.<br /><br />WATERPROOF?<br />I did not have any experience with rain- the entire time the tent was set up, there was no rain.  I will have to update about that.<br /><br />PRIVACY<br />The top of this tent is white and quite thin.  If you want privacy, you might want to keep in mind that you can probably see through it at night with a light on.  The windows are a good height if you plan to sleep in a cot, mattress, or sleeping bag.<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />Of course, I can only answer this over time, but so far, the construction of this tent is impressive, as long as you put down a tarp to protect the floor and keep applying waterproofing.<br /><br />WEIGHT<br />This tent is made to stand up- that means that the poles are sturdy and strong.  They are HEAVY.  That means that this is a substantial package to carry.  It is not for backpacking, but it will be a great base to set up if you are going out climbing or exploring with a small backpack tent.<br /><br />WHAT I WISH THEY HAD DONE<br />I wish they had put ties on the windows.  As small as that sounds, I think it matters in a tent situation.  I also wish that they had a hook or ring coming down from the center of the ceiling to hang a lantern or light from.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Despite a few minor changes I would prefer, this is a nice tent.  The poles are a great design and made to be strong.  The package comes with everything you need to set up a sturdy nice tent, but you may want to purchase better stakes.  A great comfortable tent for two to four people ( six if you are like sardines) if you keep up on treating for being waterproof, this tent could last some time if you take care of it.  We love the design as a whole and are glad to have this.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Even though I would like a few different things with this- like tie backs on the windows, hook on the ceiling or even a reinforced door like Colemans have, None of these are enough to give it under five stars.  The basic structure is great and hopefully will last longer than others on the market these days.<br /><br />UPDATES<br />If you have a question about this tent that I have not addressed in this review, I will be happy to update if I can.  Also, once we use it again next year I will update as well since we are approaching winter now.",0,"['review', 'serious', 'making', 'buying', 'decision', 'prefer', 'quick', 'see', 'section', 'bottom', 'line', 'family', 'tent', 'camping', 'quite', 'time', 'variety', 'tent', 'time', 'one', 'favorite', 'one', 'one', 'last', 'one', 'made', 'understand', 'lasted', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'past', 'getting', 'used', 'design', 'perfect', 'family', 'sturdy', 'husband', 'stake', 'one', 'night', 'get', 'wind', 'probably', 'still', 'got', 'wind', 'night', 'much', 'never', 'tent', 'experience', 'horrible', 'got', 'tent', 'great', 'design', 'pole', 'second', 'time', 'used', 'wind', 'bad', 'weather', 'tent', 'like', 'tent', 'like', 'design', 'year', 'ago', 'seen', 'yet', 'going', 'break', 'section', 'tent', 'easier', 'work', 'find', 'want', 'know', 'fabric', 'fabric', 'tent', 'nice', 'white', 'screen', 'see', 'thin', 'care', 'need', 'taken', 'sure', 'doe', 'pole', 'pole', 'best', 'feature', 'tent', 'side', 'pole', 'heavy', 'steel', 'steel', 'cord', 'pole', 'several', 'pole', 'set', 'pole', 'top', 'also', 'fly', 'plastic', 'quite', 'sturdy', 'better', 'time', 'sure', 'hold', 'nice', 'sturdy', 'stake', 'stake', 'inch', 'long', 'hook', 'top', 'inch', 'thick', 'straight', 'steel', 'stake', 'something', 'want', 'use', 'high', 'wind', 'extremely', 'wet', 'want', 'something', 'little', 'longer', 'purchase', 'stake', 'come', 'tent', 'cord', 'hold', 'tent', 'window', 'screen', 'tent', 'lot', 'nicely', 'window', 'also', 'nice', 'large', 'however', 'one', 'problem', 'tent', 'tie', 'window', 'roll', 'hang', 'loose', 'wish', 'put', 'tie', 'clip', 'door', 'tie', 'back', 'door', 'window', 'door', 'door', 'plenty', 'open', 'nicely', 'far', 'ground', 'open', 'nice', 'zipper', 'like', 'tent', 'little', 'pole', 'around', 'edge', 'velcro', 'perfect', 'still', 'pretty', 'nice', 'stand', 'room', 'everyone', 'family', 'plenty', 'room', 'stand', 'straight', 'including', 'family', 'set', 'set', 'tent', 'difficult', 'doe', 'take', 'least', 'two', 'people', 'going', 'put', 'kind', 'need', 'three', 'four', 'people', 'hold', 'tent', 'away', 'try', 'get', 'set', 'instruction', 'instruction', 'case', 'come', 'extra', 'like', 'put', 'storage', 'tent', 'put', 'tent', 'however', 'lot', 'case', 'many', 'time', 'tent', 'come', 'tiny', 'case', 'doe', 'store', 'tent', 'used', 'tent', 'often', 'big', 'back', 'case', 'work', 'case', 'doe', 'fit', 'tent', 'without', 'much', 'zipper', 'tent', 'come', 'tiny', 'tie', 'help', 'put', 'tent', 'back', 'fly', 'fly', 'well', 'doe', 'clip', 'place', 'nicely', 'wind', 'although', 'difficult', 'put', 'wind', 'know', 'line', 'stake', 'everything', 'tent', 'quite', 'nice', 'even', 'wind', 'stay', 'pretty', 'well', 'although', 'expect', 'make', 'wind', 'tent', 'weather', 'seems', 'fine', 'waterproof', 'experience', 'rain', 'entire', 'time', 'tent', 'set', 'rain', 'update', 'top', 'tent', 'white', 'quite', 'thin', 'want', 'might', 'want', 'keep', 'mind', 'probably', 'see', 'night', 'light', 'window', 'good', 'height', 'plan', 'sleep', 'mattress', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'durability', 'course', 'time', 'far', 'construction', 'tent', 'long', 'put', 'protect', 'floor', 'keep', 'weight', 'tent', 'made', 'stand', 'mean', 'pole', 'sturdy', 'strong', 'heavy', 'mean', 'package', 'carry', 'backpacking', 'great', 'base', 'set', 'going', 'small', 'backpack', 'tent', 'wish', 'done', 'wish', 'put', 'tie', 'window', 'small', 'sound', 'think', 'matter', 'tent', 'also', 'wish', 'hook', 'ring', 'coming', 'center', 'hang', 'lantern', 'light', 'bottom', 'line', 'despite', 'change', 'prefer', 'nice', 'tent', 'pole', 'great', 'design', 'made', 'strong', 'package', 'come', 'everything', 'need', 'set', 'sturdy', 'nice', 'tent', 'may', 'want', 'purchase', 'better', 'stake', 'great', 'comfortable', 'tent', 'two', 'four', 'people', 'six', 'like', 'keep', 'waterproof', 'tent', 'last', 'time', 'take', 'care', 'love', 'design', 'whole', 'glad', 'rating', 'even', 'though', 'like', 'different', 'thing', 'like', 'tie', 'back', 'window', 'hook', 'even', 'door', 'like', 'enough', 'give', 'five', 'star', 'basic', 'great', 'last', 'longer', 'others', 'day', 'update', 'tent', 'review', 'happy', 'update', 'also', 'use', 'next', 'year', 'update', 'well', 'since', 'winter']"

1529,5.0,Crazy comfy!,"Not gonna lie- they are not much to look at. Lol. Luckily I’m one of those ppl that values things for function over looks & these function well so far. They are seriously one of the most comfortable pairs of socks I’ve owned in 5 decades.  I have not tried to wash them yet, so fingers crossed on that rn.  They feel very cushiony.  I wear them in my winter boots & just on my feet shoeless around my home.  I wish they came in more colors.  I’m one of those ppl that absolutely cannot stand toe seams on socks, but these have not bothered me at all.  I have super high arches so the only change I would make to the socks would be some compression there.  However, the socks fit perfectly as-is which really surprised me given my arches.  I just like having compression at my arches bc it feels good on them.  I wear a ladies 10-1/2 shoe- mens 8-1/2 and I bought the medium socks. They fit perfectly.  That’s never happened.  I had honestly expected to have to get them wet on my feet & let them shrink to fit (as they dried on my feet to my size) since they are wool. Lol. I also expected to need sock liners as I’ve had issues with wool in the past (allergies- I knit & crochet it), but I’ve not had any issues with itching luckily. Hopefully the allergy is behind me now.  This week in northern Colorado I’ve worn the socks inside my boots in minus 15 degrees & can honestly say my feet were the only warm part of my body while walking my dogs.  Seriously thinking about making mittens out of a pair bc they kept my feet so warm. Lol.  Probably the best $15 I’ve ever spent on Amazon.  These are wonderfully thick & comfy socks.

1531,3.0,Usable Not Fantastic,"The size is awkward to hold unless you use the handle which feels like rather cheap plastic and I worry it will break rather easily. The light has several modes and like many low end lights you can only go from A to E, flashlight in high, flashlight in low, 360° LED lantern, 180° lantern, 360° red lantern light, flashing 360° red lantern light. If you want to turn the light off after turning it on you have to cycle through every mode to turn it off (except if you don't do anything for several seconds then you can turn it off with the next click). The flashlight high mode is incredibly bright, low is dimmer but could be less bright or a third mode could be added. The 360° lantern is very bright and fills a room nicely. The 180° lantern is useful and can be put against a wall to diffuse the output. I guess the red lantern function could be useful at not diminishing your night vision but it's a little too bright. The blinking red, that SO many lights have and no one has ever needed. . .<br />The light has a blue LED in the power switch which turns red when charging via micro-USB. There are no lights to show what level of charge is left in the light. You'll only know it needs charging when it begins to dim. That's not something I want to rely on in an emergency. There's a metal loop in the base that the lantern can be suspended from.

It makes it both more comfortable and less likely to get burned on your face.  I thought it looked fine.  It can help block the sun quite a bit. We have a strong sun here in Florida, so for us that is very nice.  It is very comfortable to wear. It fits well on the head. It doesn’t feel hot or tight at all. It feels pretty light.

1536,3.0,They have changed this glove,"I have always worn either Rawlings or LS batting gloves, and this one is almost as comfy as most, but with this latest redesign, they have added seams across the fingers. I would think they would know better--this is never a good idea, but they did it anyway. Feels pretty good, but wearing it for a prolonged length of time inside a baseball glove (which I do) may result in discomfort. The raised LV logo on the back is bigger (taller) than before and gets in the way a little, and the fabric and leather feel thinner (especially in the palm), which is not necessarily a good thing (again, especially in the palm). Time will tell how well it stands up to use (doesn't feel as high quality as the last generation). The wrist portion doesn't look wider, but it feels stiffer, and is definitely more supportive, but feels less comfortable and impedes wrist motion slightly compared to the old version. LV needs to stop changing things just for the sake of change. The latest changes have impacted functionality significantly, and at least to me, the previous glove felt better. I have attached a photo to this review of both gloves side by side. The old design is on the left. You can clearly see the horizontal seams across the fingers, and the wider wrist band on the new glove, which is on the right. 3.5 stars.",1,"['always', 'worn', 'either', 'glove', 'one', 'almost', 'comfy', 'added', 'seam', 'across', 'finger', 'think', 'know', 'better', 'never', 'good', 'idea', 'anyway', 'feel', 'pretty', 'good', 'wearing', 'length', 'time', 'inside', 'glove', 'may', 'result', 'logo', 'back', 'bigger', 'get', 'way', 'little', 'fabric', 'feel', 'especially', 'good', 'thing', 'especially', 'time', 'tell', 'well', 'stand', 'use', 'doe', 'feel', 'high', 'quality', 'last', 'wrist', 'doe', 'look', 'feel', 'definitely', 'feel', 'less', 'comfortable', 'wrist', 'slightly', 'compared', 'old', 'version', 'need', 'stop', 'thing', 'change', 'change', 'least', 'glove', 'felt', 'better', 'attached', 'photo', 'review', 'glove', 'side', 'side', 'old', 'design', 'left', 'see', 'seam', 'across', 'finger', 'wrist', 'band', 'new', 'glove', 'right', 'star']"
1537,5.0,It works!,"This thing will edge your skis and your board, but its more of a quick tune tool to get out burrs and remove rust before the start of ski season. I live on the east coast (read: ice coast) so its imperative to have sharp edges if youre skiing anything other than park. Actually even in the park. Now as far as these types of tools go, it works. Its nothing special. It doesn't change the bevel of your ski and just does a standard edge. Definitely takes a bit of pressure and a few good strokes to get the edge sharpened well, but it will get the job done and doesn't mess with your base! I did notice that if youre not really careful, it can slip off the metal edge and then you'll be running your hand down the freshly sharpened edge instead, so might be a good idea to wear some protective gloves just in case!

If you’ve seen commercials showing people quickly swiping these through the air then sealing and sitting down - that is misleading.  There must be enough airflow to adequately fill the lounger sack so that will require either a breeze or creating one.  This can be accomplished by holding it open and running or, as I do, using a battery operated fan.<br /><br />This product is different from others in this category as it has a pillow and a light built it with it - both are nice additions.  In addition there are pouches on the side perfect for storing a drink, book, sunglasses, etc.<br /><br />I got the “Glow Galaxy” model when the rechargeable battery powered light is illuminated the lounger glows a cool deep purple color illuminating the star pattern.  During the day the light really isn’t noticeable but at night it’s incredible.  The thing I’ve found I really like about having the light is when at a festival or on the beach it’s always easy to spot my group based on where my glowing lounger in located.<br /><br />As with anything like this, air will slowly leak out - the more weight or pressure applied the faster air escapes.  If someone drops too hard down on to it more air escapes.  None of this is to be unexpected.<br /><br />Sitting upright we fit 3 of us comfortably side by side although we are all relatively small.<br /><br />While at first I wasn’t sure if I was going to figure out if I could fill this and seal it without the air escaping, now that I’ve used it for a while it’s really not a big deal.

Perfect every time.  Pants are good too, just remember that they need to be the width of the bottom, center folder. Also, folding on a surface that is a good height for you is key.  I have bed that is up on feet about 4&#34; taller and so it hits me about mid thigh.  Plus it's a queen size bed.  I just pile my folding on one side and begin. My bed has the right amount of space and is the right height for me, not too much bending and you can easily see what you've got.  I have found that it works best with cotton items... chiffon, floaty, poly- you know, slippery stuff is a bit tricky and takes a bit of practice, but I've even mastered that.  My husband is a husky dude - 4x.  This folds big guy tshirts and others easily. Using the same principles you will learn from practice with regular size stuff, it's truly a breeze and LOVE how all of his shirts are all folded the same way now. Saves space and is neat and tidy without any more effort than normal manual folding.  Haven't tried the towel fold yet, but I will.  Give me time.  I'm still jumping up and down about all the clothing I can fold now! I am admiring the neat and tidy stack of clothing for my next trip as I write this.  Now, being honest, I am going to report that the &#34;hinge&#34; parts are most likely going to give out after a period of use... but as another reviewer noted, gorilla tape will correct this when it occurs. I have some of that stuff.  I will do that because frankly I will never give this thing up.  Other than what I have reported, I don't think I can add anything else.  I will, as I always do, update if there are any issues to report.  I really, honestly love this thing.

Apparently, his friend is an experienced boarder and blamed the way the wheels seem to have touched the board on a turn for the fall, which sort of goes along with what my son had been trying to describe. Maybe they are too young and this is a more advanced board, but it says for beginners on the title so I'm not sure what to think.

But I have to take off stars because there are details NOT as described in the listing or picture.<br />The issues are:<br />1) It says it comes with straps, and in the product listing picture, it shows a set of rugged flat blue hook straps. But that's NOT what you get! You get some cut length of generic purple rope (pictured). Does it do the job well enough? Yes, especially if you are handy with tying your own knots, but the listing title and photos give you the illusion of a more premium product complete with hooks, rather than the rope you actually get.<br />2) Double. I'm not sure what they mean by double, but I'd assume they mean two people can use it at once. Granted, I'm not a small guy, but the way these hammocks wrap around you, I don't see how it is possible for two people to comfortably sit in this at the same time. I guess you could say it fits double capacity the way 22 college kids fit into a phone booth on a dare. Sure, you could, but would you really advertise it as such?<br />I used to own a different type of hammock that had wood and metal parts to hold it open and flat, like a couch or bed- not a little folding portable kind like this one. THAT could fit two people comfortably looking at the stars, and in fact we regularly had more if you count kids using it like a futon. But hammocks like this one just aren't for more than one person at a time in my opinion.

1605,5.0,Excellent For Changing Up Your Workouts,This is a very good piece of workout equipment that allows you to improve your fitness in a variety of ways. The vest allows you to evenly distribute up to 44 pounds across your body. This is a lot more comfortable and much safer than carrying a weight in a backpack or something like that. The vest is very durable and can withstand the weight without any issue.<br /><br />The individual weights are metal bars that fit into 32 pockets on the vest. Each pocket can hold up to 3 bars. The pockets have a Velcro seal at the top to make sure the weights are secure.<br /><br />This vest makes it very easy to increase your workload for pullups and dips. I am a cross-country skier and marathon runner so this is a terrific product for improving leg and core strength. With this vest I can transform a family hike into a brutal workout.<br /><br />This vest is a terrific option for anyone who is serious about their fitness but has gotten bored with the gym. It allows you to get outdoors and push yourself in ways you never thought possible. It is a versatile tool for weight training and would make a thoughtful gift.,0,"['good', 'piece', 'workout', 'equipment', 'allows', 'fitness', 'variety', 'way', 'vest', 'allows', 'pound', 'across', 'body', 'lot', 'comfortable', 'much', 'carrying', 'weight', 'backpack', 'something', 'like', 'vest', 'durable', 'weight', 'without', 'issue', 'weight', 'metal', 'bar', 'fit', 'pocket', 'vest', 'pocket', 'hold', 'bar', 'pocket', 'velcro', 'seal', 'top', 'make', 'sure', 'weight', 'secure', 'vest', 'make', 'easy', 'product', 'leg', 'strength', 'vest', 'family', 'hike', 'workout', 'vest', 'option', 'anyone', 'serious', 'fitness', 'gotten', 'gym', 'allows', 'get', 'push', 'way', 'never', 'thought', 'possible', 'tool', 'weight', 'training', 'make', 'gift']"

The problem is that the way it is made, I have yet to be able to use it.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This has a great case with a zipper on it.  That protects the stove and keeps it handy to transport it while camping.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?<br />This is a camp stove.  That means that it does not have to have a mirror finish.  For some weird reason, the company that made this stove, found it necessary to cover every single stove part with blue plastic sticky protector sheet.  The problem is that they put all of the parts together and the paper won't come out of a lot of overlapping areas such as hinges and bent edges.<br /><br />THE BLUE WON'T COME OUT<br />I have tried and tried to get all of the plastic off of this stove so I could use it.  Unfortunately, even though I was using tweezers and pliers I can not get the plastic out from the hinges.  If this was not a stove for BURNING things, it might not be such an issue.  Unfortunately, I can not get the plastic out totally.  I refuse to burn this until all of the plastic is out.  All together, I have spent a few days on this combined.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />It takes a really long time to get the plastic pieces out of this unit.  Even after a few days  I am still trying to remove the plastic. I am not sure it will all ever come out.  I refuse to burn this with plastic in it since there will be food made with it.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  This stove could be a five star stove.  With this plastic problem, I am very frustrated with it and wish I had not gotten it.  If the company could put it together and leave the plastic off of the hinge and attached areas, at least you could peel it off and have not issues with it. As a camp stove, I am not interested in having a mirror finish at the expense of hours of work to remove plastic.<br /><br />PHOTOS<br />I have posted quite a few photos of this stove after I first got it and then around the first set of hinges I could not remove the plastic from.  When I can spare the time, I try to remove more plastic, but this is taking a really long time with way too much effort.",1,"['love', 'design', 'really', 'problem', 'way', 'made', 'yet', 'able', 'use', 'come', 'great', 'case', 'zipper', 'keep', 'handy', 'camping', 'problem', 'camp', 'mean', 'doe', 'weird', 'reason', 'company', 'made', 'found', 'cover', 'every', 'single', 'part', 'blue', 'plastic', 'sheet', 'problem', 'put', 'part', 'together', 'come', 'lot', 'area', 'edge', 'blue', 'come', 'tried', 'tried', 'get', 'plastic', 'use', 'unfortunately', 'even', 'though', 'using', 'get', 'plastic', 'thing', 'might', 'issue', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'plastic', 'totally', 'burn', 'plastic', 'together', 'spent', 'day', 'bottom', 'line', 'take', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'plastic', 'piece', 'unit', 'even', 'day', 'still', 'trying', 'remove', 'plastic', 'sure', 'ever', 'come', 'burn', 'plastic', 'since', 'food', 'made', 'rating', 'two', 'star', 'five', 'star', 'plastic', 'problem', 'wish', 'gotten', 'company', 'put', 'together', 'leave', 'plastic', 'attached', 'area', 'least', 'issue', 'camp', 'hour', 'work', 'remove', 'plastic', 'photo', 'quite', 'photo', 'first', 'got', 'around', 'first', 'set', 'remove', 'plastic', 'time', 'try', 'remove', 'plastic', 'taking', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'way', 'much', 'effort']"

1649,1.0,I am very disappointed in the quality of the material,"As a person who purchases fleece to make blankets, I know my material well. This fleece material is one of the cheapest that can be purchased. If you look closely at it when it arrives (I bought it online) it looks as though its slightly clumpy or matted from the start. This means that after 4-6 washes this fleece material will definitely have a matted appearance and appear much more worn than it is. The fleece fabric used is also very thin. If you turn the jacket inside out and push your finger  firmly into the fabric, it appears that it wouldn't take much pressure to tear. I'm not suggesting gauging it with a blunt object, but it should withstand normal pushing as a clothing item will get when be put on and taken off etc. Again., thats a test us fleece blanket makers check for when purchasing fabric for a blanket that we desire to last through years of &#34;normal&#34; wear and washing. I honestly do not feel this jacket would hod up well beyond maybe 6 months.<br />Columbia is known for having quality merchandise so that is why I chose this maker. I am very disappointed in the quality of the material. I am certain the reviews on here are from buyers who received their jacket, see how soft it is, tried it on and thought it was well made and left a glowing review. I am curious to hear an update from a buyer after they have worn and washed this jacket a few times. I bought this jacket on sale for $36.00 (original price tag of $60.00) Unfortunately I  am returning it today.<br /> Old Navy is known for using VERY cheap material for a majority of their clothing, however they use much better quality fleece for their jackets. I know because I own a couple Old Navy fleece jackets. they're not as stylish as Columbia. Quite plain actually, but mine have held up for several years and still look nice.  Old Navy fleece jackets go on sale for $9.99 - $14.99 often, especially around Christmas. Looks like I'll be heading back there to pick a few more up.",1,"['person', 'purchase', 'make', 'blanket', 'know', 'material', 'well', 'material', 'one', 'purchased', 'look', 'bought', 'online', 'look', 'though', 'slightly', 'start', 'mean', 'wash', 'material', 'definitely', 'much', 'worn', 'fabric', 'used', 'also', 'thin', 'turn', 'jacket', 'inside', 'push', 'finger', 'fabric', 'take', 'much', 'pressure', 'normal', 'item', 'get', 'put', 'taken', 'etc', 'test', 'blanket', 'check', 'fabric', 'blanket', 'last', 'year', 'normal', 'wear', 'washing', 'honestly', 'feel', 'jacket', 'well', 'maybe', 'month', 'quality', 'chose', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'material', 'review', 'received', 'jacket', 'see', 'soft', 'tried', 'thought', 'well', 'made', 'left', 'review', 'hear', 'update', 'worn', 'washed', 'jacket', 'time', 'bought', 'jacket', 'original', 'price', 'unfortunately', 'returning', 'today', 'old', 'using', 'cheap', 'material', 'however', 'use', 'much', 'better', 'quality', 'jacket', 'know', 'couple', 'old', 'jacket', 'quite', 'actually', 'mine', 'held', 'several', 'year', 'still', 'look', 'nice', 'old', 'jacket', 'often', 'especially', 'around', 'christmas', 'look', 'like', 'back']"
1650,5.0,So Much Fun!,"My 20 year old has been wanting one of these for a while. There's a lake near her campus and there is always a lot of people paddle boarding. This was easy to set up, though it did take a little while to get it fully inflated.  This comes with a pump, paddle (single bladed), ankle strap, and a repair kit. Everything fits nicely into a backpack which makes it easy for transporting. Once it's inflated, it is extremely rigid and it's hard to tell the difference between this and a non-inflatable one. My daughter has already taken it out on the lake and is very pleased with it.",0,"['year', 'old', 'one', 'near', 'always', 'lot', 'people', 'paddle', 'easy', 'set', 'though', 'take', 'little', 'get', 'fully', 'inflated', 'come', 'pump', 'paddle', 'single', 'ankle', 'strap', 'kit', 'everything', 'fit', 'nicely', 'backpack', 'make', 'easy', 'inflated', 'extremely', 'hard', 'tell', 'difference', 'non', 'one', 'daughter', 'already', 'taken', 'pleased']"
1651,5.0,Great for hip pain,I bought the 4 x 36 and 4 X12 foam. I place one vertically under each greater trocanter laying on my back. It really lets my sacrum relax and hips get into alignment. I have pelvic torsion so this helps me feel neutral because I'm always twisted and can't get straight. It also helps my sacral torsion when I rock my sacrum on it.  The foam is also great under each butt cheek along the sit behind l bone while laying flat to help release a tight hip flexor. I also sit on it on one sit bone when one hip gets higher than the other to help balance the pelvis.

1656,5.0,Sharpal 6 in 1 pocket knife sharpener and survival tool,"We purchased a couple of these, sharing them with a few relatives who are intense hikers.

1657,4.0,Quality for the price. Minor cosmetic flaws.,"I bought this product for moderate general purpose use (sit-ups, push-ups, dumbbells) in a basement with poured concrete floors covered with linoleum tiles.<br /><br />Physically: 6 mats and 12 edge pieces were included. In a 2x3 arrangement, the mats measure about 49.25&#34; x 72.375&#34; roughly. It was difficult to measure the mats because they varied, in my experience, by about a quarter inch from one side to the other, over the 6 foot length. A 1x6 arrangement is not possible because it would require 14 edge pieces of 12 that are included. They seem to be made of a very dense foam.<br /><br />Cosmetically: All of my pieces appear similar from afar (no discernible color difference unlike some other reviews). The photo on the back of the product picture shipped with the package has one tile of the six that does not match the others slightly, leading me to believe that it is normal to expect a tile that doesn't entirely match and it seems that I got one but it wasn't a color difference. One of my tiles is significantly grittier and more textured than the other 5 which makes me suspect they aren't all from the same manufacturing batch. The pattern of the tiles isn't entirely straight either and over a six foot length, its noticeable how it seems to run off the side. This matters when you go to interlock the other puzzle pieces because the pattern then doesn't always line up (and I couldn't find a way for all of mine to line up right in a 2x3 arrangement)<br /><br />Summary: If you're going to do sit-ups on these mats, you may want another softer mat to put on top of these but it should work anyway. They have a comfortable amount of give under the ball of the foot of an 180lb man when walking across them. The texture on the top makes them fairly slip resistant. Personally, I would have preferred squared corners rather than the rounded ones for the corner of a room. The durability is alright for me as I will use these alone, but I'm not sure if I would want to put something as heavy as exercise equipment on it. All in all, for less than $30, they are a bargain compared to the other prices of mats that I have seen (and have not owned). I would buy this product again if I had to replace them.",0,"['bought', 'product', 'purpose', 'use', 'sit', 'push', 'floor', 'mat', 'edge', 'piece', 'included', 'mat', 'difficult', 'mat', 'experience', 'inch', 'one', 'side', 'foot', 'length', 'possible', 'edge', 'piece', 'included', 'seem', 'made', 'foam', 'piece', 'similar', 'color', 'difference', 'review', 'photo', 'back', 'product', 'picture', 'package', 'one', 'six', 'doe', 'match', 'others', 'slightly', 'believe', 'normal', 'expect', 'doe', 'match', 'seems', 'got', 'one', 'color', 'difference', 'one', 'make', 'straight', 'either', 'six', 'foot', 'length', 'seems', 'run', 'side', 'matter', 'piece', 'doe', 'always', 'line', 'find', 'way', 'mine', 'line', 'right', 'going', 'sit', 'mat', 'may', 'want', 'another', 'mat', 'put', 'top', 'work', 'anyway', 'comfortable', 'amount', 'give', 'ball', 'foot', 'walking', 'across', 'top', 'make', 'fairly', 'slip', 'resistant', 'personally', 'rather', 'one', 'room', 'durability', 'use', 'sure', 'want', 'put', 'something', 'heavy', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'less', 'compared', 'price', 'mat', 'seen', 'buy', 'product', 'replace']"

1665,5.0,Truly enhances air matresses,"I received this as a review sample along with the base air mattress ([[ASIN:B00IHX26X6 Lightspeed Outdoors 2-Person PVC-Free Air Bed with Battery Operated Pump]]). The product description provides all of the dimensions and the previous reviews are also detailed, so I will avoid repeating those - especially the product description.<br /><br />This is offered as a general purpose topper that will fit a variety of brands. I tested it on the air mattress, but also on my bed. It securely affixes to the air mattress, but not my bed. I expected the way it fit the bed because it is not designed for those. In both cases, though, it is comfortable. In fact, the air mattress without it was ... just an air mattress, but with this topper is as comfortable as any bed in which I've slept.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, getting it into the included bag is a chore, but it is relatively light and compact for folks who camp. For those of us who are going to use this in the home with an air mattress for guests, it will store easily in most linen closets, as well as in some deeper drawers (the bottom drawer in my chest of drawers holds it.<br /><br />I did not see any cleaning instructions, but given the size it probably will need to be professionally cleaned (and eventually it will). It will definitely not fit in my large size washer.<br /><br />Overall, if you have never used one of these toppers you probably will not see the need.

No problems with pinching or sticking on the rollers,"I really like this bit for trail work with my 14 year old Andalusian stallion. He has a soft mouth and doesn't require a heavy hand or bit as a rule, but when riding in the company of mares, he can become a bit mouthy and prancy - well mannered, but still a stallion wanting to meet the ladies. (I do not use tie downs or anything like that. Stallions must be gentle or gelded in our barn.) The rollers here give him something to do and think about on slower walking sections of a trail or stops and the bit is just a tiny bit heavier than a regular d-ring. I've never noticed any signs of the rollers pinching and my boy has never declined to accept it. I do check the rollers after every use for indentations or sharp edges and I have had to replace the bit a couple of times over the years - but that's not a big deal.",0,"['really', 'like', 'bit', 'trail', 'work', 'year', 'old', 'soft', 'mouth', 'doe', 'heavy', 'hand', 'bit', 'riding', 'company', 'bit', 'well', 'still', 'use', 'tie', 'anything', 'like', 'must', 'roller', 'give', 'something', 'think', 'walking', 'section', 'trail', 'stop', 'bit', 'tiny', 'bit', 'heavier', 'regular', 'ring', 'never', 'noticed', 'roller', 'boy', 'never', 'check', 'roller', 'every', 'use', 'sharp', 'edge', 'replace', 'bit', 'couple', 'time', 'year', 'big', 'deal']"

The knockoffs are generally kind of cheap but some have had some great ideas and improvements- but none have impressed me as much as this one. The curve of the inflated product is unique as far as I can tell, and fantastic for making it more comfortable. You don't ""fall in and get swallowed"" as much as other versions and it is easier to get in and out of as well. I'm hoping this will hold up and last over time, but so far I'm just impressed that people are still improving upon this concept.<br />If you aren't familiar, the idea is to hold the opening towards the wind and use it to inflate the bag. If there's no wind you can move or run a few feet to capture air, then tighten the end and wrap it up so the rest of the bag is tight and takes on the shape of a lounger. I've found that these are great for not just outdoor lounging, but fun for movie night with the kids inside as well. You can totally use a fan to help inflate it if indoors- just hold the opening in front of the fan and pretend it is wind.<br />This is a great product and I recommend it if you're interested in trying one!",0,"['several', 'year', 'back', 'original', 'kind', 'cheap', 'great', 'idea', 'impressed', 'much', 'one', 'inflated', 'product', 'far', 'tell', 'making', 'comfortable', 'fall', 'get', 'much', 'version', 'easier', 'get', 'well', 'hoping', 'hold', 'last', 'time', 'far', 'impressed', 'people', 'still', 'upon', 'concept', 'idea', 'hold', 'opening', 'wind', 'use', 'inflate', 'bag', 'wind', 'move', 'run', 'foot', 'air', 'tighten', 'end', 'wrap', 'rest', 'bag', 'tight', 'take', 'shape', 'found', 'great', 'fun', 'night', 'kid', 'inside', 'well', 'totally', 'use', 'fan', 'help', 'inflate', 'hold', 'opening', 'front', 'fan', 'wind', 'great', 'product', 'recommend', 'trying', 'one']"

Twirling a hula hoop is one way to get the body moving and the heart rate climbing without the need for much space. If you want something like a hula hoop but with certain advantages compared to one, then you might like this Smart Hoola Fitness Hoop.<br /><br />To use this hula hoop substitute, you put it on and attach the links. The weighted piece then twirls around while you move your hips. The hoop itself holds snugly to your body, so you don’t need to worry about trying to keep it up while you move your hips, like you do with a traditional hula hoop.<br /><br />Putting this together is a little confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it’s not bad. The massage feature is nice and it’s something you certainly don’t get with a traditional hula hoop. The weight is just the right size. I was worried that it would be too hard on my back, but it wasn’t. I recommend starting with just 10 minutes then build up to the 30. If you can make a hula hoop work, then you can easily do this. If not, you can pick it up pretty fast.<br /><br />I like all the new and improved variations on traditional means of fitness.

I love the ball is not “the ugly black spare tire look that accidentally got left out in the living room..!!<br /><br />The ridged ball serves a purpose which is something some don’t know! This has “small ridges” (a few inches apart) that circumference the ball. These help keep a person in place when using (sort of like tread on a tire but, it’s not grabby!) I see this very beneficial for any who may need a little extra help ie. hindered with Injury, elderly or, just need or lack natural balance..<br /><br />Although supplied with a hand pump- be prepared for this to take a lot of effort/time to inflate- the better part of an hour.. (especially with 75cm size!!) This has a thick outer surface to keep it from puncture or bursting- which is nice to give user peace of mind. *This has an internal air bladder in case exterior puncture takes place.. it’s made to “break ones fall“ to the ground and let you down slower so to speak. Slower = 1.5sec to deflate so it breaks the impact if popped vs. hitting ground hard if it pops.. (trust me, it still can scare you but, 1.5 makes all the difference!) Bc of time to fill- we ended up using an electric pump to make quicker work of the task.. Those younger with more muscle may not find this as tedious. Just note: this IS compatible with an electric pump and worth getting it out for the job!!<br /><br />Overall, this is  X1 of the more solid yoga balls I’ve seen- it has such an eye on quality and built in safety Im impressed.

1780,3.0,Lightweight backpack too big for anything but light items; it’s water resistant,"I ordered this pack in their [[ASIN:B07RHNRB6R smaller 20L size]] and decided to order this larger one as well.<br /><br />This backpack is a bit unexpected in its design. It folds into the exterior pocket. Therefore, the pouch that it came in is actually the outside pocket of the pack. All I had to do was unzip the pouch and unfold the backpack from within that pouch. The act of unfurling the bag forms the lower exterior zippered pocket. All that was left was to do was to tuck the loop inside and zipper the pocket.<br /><br />I was able to fit some heavy books inside with room to spare. However, I do not recommend using this for books or a computer. Since there is no padding in the straps, it is uncomfortable to walk long distances with this unless the items inside are lightweight--like soft clothing.<br /><br />The material reminds me of the baggalini-type bags made of a strong nylon. However, this backpack is thin, so I do feel anything with sharp edges would tear through this after prolonged use.  The material is water resistant. I put part of the pack under running water and the water just rolled right off.<br /><br />Besides two exterior pockets and one interior folder pocket, there are two mesh water bottle pockets on each side that fit my standard-sized water bottles with room to spare. The shoulder straps have a tiny pocket on each side for a flip phone or perhaps tissues, etc. There is a chest strap and side cinch straps, since this is a larger (meaning taller) bag. The tiny reflective strips at the edges of the outside pocket, in the center of the bag, and on the outside mesh of the water bottle pockets are a nice safety touch. In this larger size, they sewed the reflector strap to the outside of the water bottle pockets which allows it to be shown. They did not do that correctly with the smaller version.<br /><br />Overall, for the current price of $21.99 plus 5% off with a coupon savings, I feel this is competitively priced. It packs small and light and is perfect to carry around for when an extra backpack is needed. However, this 35L size is taller than a full-sized backpack and comes without any cushioning. The water bottle pockets are a little wide, so larger bottles will fit in those pockets.  I would not put a laptop in this unless it is protected with a padded sleever or otterbox type case. I would also not carry anything heavy in here since there is no shoulder padding; I certainly found it to be uncomfortable to use with heavy items inside. My other version is smaller and heavy items in that one are not as uncomfortable as in this larger size.",1,"['ordered', 'pack', 'asin', 'smaller', 'size', 'decided', 'order', 'larger', 'one', 'well', 'backpack', 'bit', 'design', 'fold', 'pocket', 'pouch', 'came', 'actually', 'outside', 'pocket', 'pack', 'pouch', 'backpack', 'within', 'pouch', 'bag', 'lower', 'pocket', 'left', 'loop', 'inside', 'zipper', 'pocket', 'able', 'fit', 'heavy', 'inside', 'room', 'however', 'recommend', 'using', 'since', 'padding', 'strap', 'uncomfortable', 'walk', 'long', 'distance', 'unless', 'item', 'inside', 'lightweight', 'like', 'soft', 'material', 'type', 'bag', 'made', 'strong', 'however', 'backpack', 'thin', 'feel', 'anything', 'sharp', 'edge', 'use', 'material', 'water', 'resistant', 'put', 'part', 'pack', 'running', 'water', 'water', 'right', 'two', 'pocket', 'one', 'pocket', 'two', 'mesh', 'water', 'bottle', 'pocket', 'side', 'fit', 'standard', 'sized', 'water', 'bottle', 'room', 'shoulder', 'strap', 'tiny', 'pocket', 'side', 'phone', 'perhaps', 'etc', 'strap', 'side', 'strap', 'since', 'larger', 'bag', 'tiny', 'edge', 'outside', 'pocket', 'center', 'bag', 'outside', 'mesh', 'water', 'bottle', 'pocket', 'nice', 'safety', 'touch', 'larger', 'size', 'strap', 'outside', 'water', 'bottle', 'pocket', 'allows', 'correctly', 'smaller', 'version', 'overall', 'current', 'price', 'plus', 'feel', 'priced', 'pack', 'small', 'light', 'perfect', 'carry', 'around', 'extra', 'backpack', 'needed', 'however', 'size', 'full', 'sized', 'backpack', 'come', 'without', 'water', 'bottle', 'pocket', 'little', 'wide', 'larger', 'bottle', 'fit', 'pocket', 'put', 'unless', 'type', 'case', 'also', 'carry', 'anything', 'heavy', 'since', 'shoulder', 'padding', 'certainly', 'found', 'uncomfortable', 'use', 'heavy', 'item', 'inside', 'version', 'smaller', 'heavy', 'item', 'one', 'uncomfortable', 'larger', 'size']"

1787,4.0,Good for those who want to maintain the same tension for awhile or adjust individual finger tension; but tension is not marked,"I had carpal tunnel surgery on both hands a couple of years ago. As a result of the surgery, I had no strength in my hands. In order to build strength, I purchased some of the same tools the therapist had in her office in addition to other tools that serve the same purpose. I also continually look for new exercisers such as this to see how they stack up against what I have.<br /><br />The CanDo GripMasters are my first choice over this exerciser; however, this is a close second. First, I like the silicone base which makes it easy on the palm of my hand. Second, the tension available is from 5 to 9 pounds. The negative is that I only know the tension because of the marking on the packaging. There's no way to tell the tension on the unit itself. However, once I know that it extends from 5 to 9 pounds, I can count the tension based on the linear marks the wheel touches as I rotate the tightener for each finger in 1/2 pound increments. This is a big hate for me. They need to mark from 5 to 9 pounds on the unit itself and not just the packaging. If I were cycling through a workout of various tensions, I would not like this unit as I have to adjust the tension four times for each  pressure increase of a 1/2 pound. Someone who had carpal tunnel may get trigger finger (like I did) and having to make adjustments repeatedly is bad for those fingers. Nevertheless, if I wanted all the tensions in one unit and did not intend to graduate in strength until I have am successful at the lower tensions, then this unit would be perfect.

I actually tried the seat post mount first but it wouldn't clamp firmly around the 1"" seat post, even with the included rubber shim. I'm happy with the under-seat mount because it looks much more clean & is more firmly mounted.<br /><br />The best setting for the tail light is the motion-activated break light but that requires cycling through the other 3 flashing options first.

1823,4.0,Nice Quality,"My teenagers have been wanting a basketball hoop for a while. This one seems to be a nice quality one. First of all, we did not receive any instructions. My husband went to the Franklin Sports website and ended up contacting them. They emailed him a PDF with the instructions within a short time. It came with a couple of little wrenches to put it together, but my husband used his own socket set which made it a little easier. He put it together by himself, but he said it would definitely be easier with a second person. You can adjust the height, but it's not something you would do frequently. Some others have a lever that you can use to change the height. This one requires you to unscrew the screw and then adjust the tube (within a tube - telescoping). It's kind of like the pop up tents, except instead of the button you have to press, you have to unscrew the screw. It would be much easier to have a second person to help you if you are changing heights.  My husband found it easier to put the whole thing on the side to adjust the height. There are wheels on the bottom of the base so you can move it if needed. We have a two door garage and have it placed against the brick between the doors.

We are both dive certified and snorkel whenever we get the opportunity to do a fun beach vacation, so I thought this mask would be great.

It’s gray with gold paint and some chrome-colored trim, eye catching but not gaudy.<br /><br />In operation this reel is a smooth operator. The cast and retrieve are smooth in terms of what the reel handles; that is, line peels off easily and the retrieve is smooth and glassy, though this can be impacted negatively by what rod you use. It has an excellent zero-reverse clutch and when engaged gives no reverse play at all, not even a tiny bit. The drag system is also very good and it can be set to be very stiff and unyielding for larger fish or soft and sensitive for smaller fish.<br /><br />The handle is surprisingly large, bigger than that of most reels. For smaller hands it might be a little awkward because of the size, but for me it is very comfortable and easy to work with.<br /><br />This is a nice reel and so far I am happy with it. It works smoothly and it seems to be made very well, and the fact that it looks attractive is a plus. The price point is the cherry on top that makes it easy to recommend.",0,"['recently', 'manufacturer', 'far', 'experience', 'rod', 'reel', 'reel', 'use', 'far', 'fine', 'reel', 'worked', 'well', 'size', 'available', 'large', 'hand', 'type', 'fish', 'need', 'room', 'run', 'good', 'sized', 'reel', 'excellent', 'body', 'product', 'description', 'thought', 'resistant', 'good', 'nice', 'smooth', 'like', 'paint', 'eye', 'reel', 'smooth', 'smooth', 'reel', 'handle', 'line', 'easily', 'smooth', 'though', 'rod', 'use', 'excellent', 'give', 'play', 'even', 'tiny', 'bit', 'system', 'also', 'good', 'set', 'stiff', 'larger', 'fish', 'soft', 'smaller', 'fish', 'handle', 'large', 'bigger', 'reel', 'smaller', 'hand', 'might', 'little', 'size', 'comfortable', 'easy', 'work', 'nice', 'reel', 'far', 'happy', 'work', 'smoothly', 'seems', 'made', 'well', 'fact', 'look', 'plus', 'price', 'point', 'top', 'make', 'easy', 'recommend']"

1847,3.0,Glad I bought it ... but it could use some tweaks,I've been wanting a hat that would keep the gnats and bugs out of my face while I'm working outside.

The brim probably needs to be a bit larger to keep the netting further out from touching your face.  The netting material definitely clouds your view/vision especially when there are folds in the netting put that's a small price to pay not to have to keep waving away the gnats.

With the display, what I don’t like specifically is the annoyance with looking at your statistics from past days. It stores up to a week’s worth of data, which is great, but if you want to view the data from a past day, you have to toggle back and forth between two of the buttons. You can’t just simply go back to the day you want and then view the steps, aerobic steps, time, distance, and calories with one push. You have to push the button to the left a couple of times, then push the button on the right to view one stat, then push the button on the left a couple of times again to view the next stat, etc. Other pedometers are much easier than this.<br />Another problem is with the tendency of the screen to go blank. This happens to me anytime I drop the pedometer. I have to then get a small screwdriver to remove the back, move the battery around, and screw it back on. The display will them reappear. And, of course, there is the problem with inability to shut the pedometer off. With other pedometers, you can turn it off or it will shut off itself after a certain amount of time has elapsed. It doesn’t work that way here. The display is always on, draining the battery at a fast rate. Sure, you could pop out the battery after each use, but this is too much trouble. Just make sure you have plenty of replacement batteries on hand because you’re going to need them.<br /><br />So, taken as a whole, this is device is not as good as I expected and I plan to search for a replacement very soon. It’s disappointing for something from Omron. I have had better luck with other pedometers from this company and cannot give this one a recommendation for the reasons cited.",1,"['used', 'different', 'day', 'like', 'purchased', 'one', 'due', 'solid', 'review', 'anything', 'overall', 'rating', 'good', 'product', 'worth', 'money', 'old', 'decided', 'time', 'new', 'one', 'purchased', 'model', 'pocket', 'okay', 'first', 'doe', 'total', 'step', 'step', 'time', 'distance', 'seems', 'pretty', 'good', 'like', 'monitor', 'check', 'thing', 'online', 'good', 'quality', 'product', 'product', 'point', 'display', 'lack', 'ability', 'display', 'like', 'looking', 'past', 'day', 'store', 'week', 'worth', 'great', 'want', 'past', 'day', 'back', 'two', 'button', 'simply', 'back', 'day', 'want', 'step', 'step', 'time', 'distance', 'one', 'push', 'push', 'button', 'left', 'couple', 'time', 'push', 'button', 'right', 'one', 'push', 'button', 'left', 'couple', 'time', 'next', 'etc', 'much', 'easier', 'another', 'problem', 'screen', 'drop', 'get', 'small', 'remove', 'back', 'move', 'battery', 'around', 'screw', 'back', 'display', 'course', 'problem', 'turn', 'amount', 'time', 'doesn', 'work', 'way', 'display', 'always', 'battery', 'fast', 'rate', 'sure', 'pop', 'battery', 'use', 'much', 'trouble', 'make', 'sure', 'plenty', 'replacement', 'battery', 'hand', 'going', 'need', 'taken', 'whole', 'device', 'good', 'expected', 'plan', 'replacement', 'soon', 'disappointing', 'something', 'better', 'company', 'give', 'one', 'reason']"
1879,5.0,Great Design On These Gloves- Pockets too!,"When I first sent for these, it was because winters where I live can be really tough.  The glove monster always seems to eat up one glove of various pair of them, so I am always on the lookout for some good ones.  Let's see how these are..<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE GLOVES LIKE?<br />LENGTH<br />These gloves are beautifully designed.  They are long gloves that go halfway up the forearm.  You can wear them over or under a jacket sleeve.<br /><br />OUTERFABRIC<br />The outer fabric is a tightly woven black fabric which is a nylon.  It is medium thickness, not thin.  The palm of the hand is rubberized for easy gripping.  There is also rubberized fabric on the tips of each finger as well as entire inner thumb.<br /><br />LINING FABRIC<br />The lining is a fleece lining<br /><br />LINING STABILITY<br />The lining seems to be sewn up into the glove so they won't be pulling out constantly like some do.<br /><br />WRIST ADJUSTMENT<br />These have band on them which is not stretch.  It is webbing.  There is an adjustable gripper buckle to pull it tighter if you want to, keeping snow and cold air away from the hand.  It is not too hard to make larger again.<br /><br />POCKET<br />These have a really cool feature- a pocket on the outside of each glove.  It zips shut and is big enough to carry a key, credit card, flash drive (OOooo James Bond feature), or anything of comparable size that is not too bulky.  That makes it handy to have if you don't carry a purse, pouch, bag, or have pockets accessible easily on the outside in severe weather.<br /><br />FOREARM ADJUSTMENT<br />This also has an elastic band at the forearm which can be pulled and locked with a press button lock barrel which is sewn down to the glove so it won't flap around.<br /><br />SIZING<br />I have a large sized woman's hand, and my husband has a medium to large sized hand in men's.  This fit us both very well with no fingers abnormally long like happens with some gloves. There is plenty of room for those with slightly longer fingers than normal.<br /><br />LEAKING?<br />I can not try these in the snow at this time, but when putting splashes of water on them, it was repellant.  I will update in the future during the snow season. (it is mid summer right now).<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a REALLY WELL DESIGNED glove that fits well and is well made, this is a great choice.  The special features it has are handy to have and I know we will use these a lot this coming winter.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will update in the future if I discover something in the dead of winter to add, but for now, I am VERY impressed with these.",0,"['first', 'sent', 'winter', 'live', 'really', 'glove', 'always', 'seems', 'one', 'glove', 'various', 'pair', 'always', 'good', 'one', 'let', 'see', 'glove', 'like', 'length', 'glove', 'designed', 'long', 'glove', 'wear', 'jacket', 'sleeve', 'fabric', 'black', 'fabric', 'medium', 'thickness', 'thin', 'hand', 'easy', 'also', 'fabric', 'tip', 'finger', 'well', 'entire', 'fabric', 'seems', 'glove', 'like', 'wrist', 'adjustment', 'band', 'stretch', 'adjustable', 'pull', 'want', 'keeping', 'cold', 'air', 'away', 'hand', 'hard', 'make', 'larger', 'pocket', 'really', 'cool', 'feature', 'pocket', 'outside', 'glove', 'zip', 'big', 'enough', 'carry', 'key', 'card', 'feature', 'anything', 'size', 'bulky', 'make', 'handy', 'carry', 'pouch', 'bag', 'pocket', 'easily', 'outside', 'weather', 'adjustment', 'also', 'elastic', 'band', 'pulled', 'press', 'button', 'lock', 'glove', 'around', 'sizing', 'large', 'sized', 'woman', 'hand', 'husband', 'medium', 'large', 'sized', 'hand', 'fit', 'well', 'finger', 'long', 'like', 'glove', 'plenty', 'room', 'slightly', 'longer', 'finger', 'normal', 'try', 'time', 'putting', 'water', 'update', 'season', 'summer', 'right', 'bottom', 'line', 'really', 'well', 'designed', 'glove', 'fit', 'well', 'well', 'made', 'great', 'choice', 'feature', 'handy', 'know', 'use', 'lot', 'coming', 'winter', 'rating', 'five', 'star', 'update', 'something', 'winter', 'add', 'impressed']"

1884,2.0,Very small,"[[VIDEOID:670390d5f4bbbcd1c8a0c687f3650946]] Let me start by saying that I am a person that does a lot of research before buying an item. I don't spend on a whim. It may take me weeks or a month before making that buying commitment. I look for something that has all the features I need.<br />  I was looking to replace my air Jordan sling that I've had for at least 15 years , maybe longer. First choice was another air Jordan but I could not get the same style..so I started hunting.<br />  This brand seemed to fit my needs. Had many of the same feature as my old backpack..and this has a bottle holder which my old one did not have. BONUS :) So I waited till prime day and got this for 10dollars cheaper . Oh ,and the reviews were decent .<br />  Well it arrived today and I couldn't be more disappointed. This is really small for my needs. Measurements on this are embellished. Reviews said this was great for a day trip or hike but honestly if you just wear a Tshirt and shorts you would be ok. I wanted to fit work clothes and my lunch in this bag but that isn't happening.<br />  There are many pockets but let's be honest, you can only fit so much inside this bag. Extra pockets don't give you more space, they provide just separation.<br />  We shall see how the durability of this is. No way it will give me 15 years as I'm pretty rough on my bag as it goes everywhere I go. It's hard letting go of a good pair of shoes or a bag or any fashion you have had for many years cause it's hard to replace something so durable. I'm sure many have had that experience.<br />  Overall this is just to small for my needs as you can see in the picture. The measurements are a stretch. Durability we will see and I will update.<br />1 WEEK later......no issues with the bag. I have been gentle as far as overstuffing it. The size issue is muy inconvenient. Many issues on that topic but just one......I work outdoors and head to work with a hoodie cause its chilly in the a.m. the hoodie wont fit in the bag when the weather warms and i only have a shirt, lunchbag, phone/charger, misc stuff already in it.. Reading the comments , This makes me curious what kind of day trip people are taking in order to use this bag in that fashion..",1,"['videoid', 'let', 'start', 'person', 'doe', 'lot', 'buying', 'item', 'spend', 'may', 'take', 'week', 'month', 'making', 'buying', 'look', 'something', 'feature', 'need', 'looking', 'replace', 'air', 'least', 'year', 'maybe', 'longer', 'first', 'choice', 'another', 'air', 'get', 'style', 'started', 'brand', 'seemed', 'fit', 'need', 'many', 'feature', 'old', 'backpack', 'bottle', 'holder', 'old', 'one', 'day', 'got', 'cheaper', 'review', 'decent', 'well', 'arrived', 'today', 'disappointed', 'really', 'small', 'need', 'review', 'said', 'great', 'day', 'trip', 'hike', 'honestly', 'wear', 'short', 'wanted', 'fit', 'work', 'bag', 'many', 'pocket', 'let', 'honest', 'fit', 'much', 'inside', 'bag', 'extra', 'pocket', 'give', 'space', 'provide', 'see', 'durability', 'way', 'give', 'year', 'pretty', 'bag', 'hard', 'good', 'pair', 'shoe', 'bag', 'many', 'year', 'cause', 'hard', 'replace', 'something', 'durable', 'sure', 'many', 'experience', 'overall', 'small', 'need', 'see', 'picture', 'stretch', 'durability', 'see', 'update', 'week', 'later', 'issue', 'bag', 'far', 'size', 'issue', 'many', 'issue', 'one', 'work', 'head', 'work', 'cause', 'fit', 'bag', 'weather', 'shirt', 'phone', 'charger', 'stuff', 'already', 'reading', 'make', 'kind', 'day', 'trip', 'people', 'taking', 'order', 'use', 'bag']"

1886,1.0,"actual contents ok, case totally different, please read review for more info","The information provided in the written part of the product description needs to line up with the pictures as well as what is actually sent. It is NOT THE SAME as what you read or see. There are some spots that are the same, and many that are different. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS based on the mixed information.<br /><br />HERE IS WHAT I RECEIVED:<br />--A smooth, zippered soft ""hard shell"" case (firm but flexible. Think of a cheap sunglass case). This is not at all what is pictured NOR described in the product information. What is pictured is a totally different material. It may not make a difference if you are just looking for some supplies, OR it may make all the difference if you are looking for a particular container as well as supplies. With this as the description, ""Durable & Portable Tactical Molle Pouch】ETROL mini Survival Gear is ultralight, compact and portable with a Velcro strap system compatible with MOLLE so that it can be hooked to the backpack, belt or other. It offers large compartments and plenty of room to add your own equipment, including a special phone pocket and an emergency pen slot"" NOPE NOPE NONE OF THIS. Just a smooth zippered shell. No means to use it as part of MOLLE system, no extra compartments or special pockets or place to have a pen. They are describing a product even different than shown, and even further off from what I received.<br /><br />--The product description also states (as of 3/31/20) that, ""【Quick Access & Top Quality Durable Supplies】The Survival Gear Kit includes the most popular outdoor survival necessities: 3-mode Tactical Flashlight, black stainless steel Tactical Military Knife, Fire Starter, Compass of the military class, a Multi-Function Tool Card, a loudly Whistle with 120db, Emergency Blankets which can retain 90% of body heat and more. Being customized and uniquely tested, our Survival First Aid Kit is designed to prepare you well in case of outdoor activities "" NOPE!! Plastic whistle and emergency blanket, yes. Flashlight, military knife, fire starter, compass, Multi function tool card.. NOPE.  I actually didn't expect this, but for it to state this in the description? False advertisement!<br /><br />Kit is described as measuring 7.5"" x 5.1"" x 2""<br />MY KIT measures roughly, 6.5"" x 4.75"" x 2.5""<br /><br />--The product description DOES seem to accurately state the medical supplies portion, ""【FDA Approved & Professional Treatment Supplies】This First Aid Kit contains the most important first aid supplies for various treatments on the market. Buckle Tourniquet, PBT conforming bandage, Tourniquet, non-woven tape, first aid scissors, plastic tweezers, sterile gauze, a lot of alcohol swabs, cotton swabs, PE adhesive bandages, and safety pins, to stop massive bleeding, dressing or disinfection of wounds nd more, which will come in handy in case of unforeseen events"". To see what you are getting, I can say that it 100% matches up to the product description PICTURE of the supplies. ((NOT THE CASE, though))<br /><br />Furthermore,<br />--The kit I have has a fairly useless first aid manual. It is labeled as being by ""Firstar"" (as are the medical packaging), and is visually messy as well as minimally informative. Consider it non essential and add your own emergency steps. As for the contents, again, it is as described according to the product description and pictures. YET If compared to the information provided on the manual, it would not come close to being the same items. For what it is worth, what comes in this kit according to the product description picture is much better.<br /><br />--Other plusses include that I am pleased with all that is in there, how well it is packed, how easy it is to access the items as well as how surprisingly easy it was to get everything back into the container.<br /><br />--However I take issue with the misinformation between what is described and what I received. Even if they totally took out the part on all the tactical goodies that is supposed to be in it, and just focused on the medical.. then there would still be the problem of the TOTALLY DIFFERENT case than what is pictured and described. The soft/hard shell zippered case is OK enough, and would be FINE if it were pictured and described as such. But if you are expecting a MOLLE bag/attach capable (that's a big thing), then this would be hugely disappointing.<br /><br />--So overall, I can not in good conscience recommend a product when it is so far off from what is pictured and described. I have no idea what it costs, and you better believe that a MOLLE style/attachment capable bag is worth more than this soft/hard shell.<br /><br />--I would include pictures but the photo/video  uploader that Amazon usually has in the reviews has been missing for about a week now. If I see that it comes back up, I will be sure to show you the case I have, then you can see how different it is.  Again, case is a firm smooth soft shell with zipper. Bright red and labeled, ""first aid kit""<br /><br />If the product description (plus pic of the container) changes, then I can edit this as is reasonable.<br /><br />Again-- the actual contents according to the picture/graphic is correct. The case is not. The description of the case and other items is entirely wrong. The list of items this kit contains according to the useless weird manual is also wrong, BUT the items included here are better. SO do with this information as you will. I hope it helped you today. Despite the errors in information, it is possible that what I described happens to be exactly what you are looking for.

The bandages do not stay stuck long. The one I used fell off easily when I peeled it back a little.<br /><br />There is a long plastic tweezer that is not very good for precision work. There's also a CPR mask, alcohol wipes, a very cheap scissor that just barely works, lots of good safety pins, etc. I personally would have preferred some antibiotic ointment to be included.<br /><br />I did not count the items, but the 87 pieces are broken down as follows. <br /><br />- 5 x Knuckle Bandage<br />- 20 x Adhesive Bandage(10*40mm)<br />-10 x Adhesive Bandage(0.22mm)<br />- 30 x Adhesive Bandage(19*72mm)<br />-1 x Roll Adhesive Tape(1.25cm*5y)<br />-1 x Roll PBT Bandage(7.5cm*4.5m)<br />- 1 x CPR Mask<br />-1 x PVC Gloves<br />-12 x Safety Pins<br />- 1 x Scissors<br />- 1 x Plastic Tweezer<br />- 3 x Alcohol Free Cleansing Wipe<br />- 1 x Pocket First Aid Guide<br />- 1 x Storage Bag<br /><br />The current price of $13.49 ($14.99 minus 10%) is too expensive for this. My recommendation is to create a personalized kit or add to this one with some better tools.

1908,3.0,There Are Some Issues,"This arrived today and I was very anxious to try to set it up. We camped a lot when I was a child and setting up the tent always involved a lot of cussing on someone's part. This wasn't too different an experience in some ways.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Fairly easy to set up the first time out of the box. I did it by myself.<br />Lightweight enough for a woman to carry<br />Large floor space and tall enough for a 6' 2&#34; man to stand up in.<br />Lots of vents and windows<br />Nice rainfly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Impossible directions. You don't need them too much to get set up, but you need some guidance to get the tent down and back in the bag. It took 3 tries to finally get it in there<br />The center beam on the top that keeps the tent stretched out, did not lock in place for us. I don't know if this is a defect or just poor design<br />Because of the lightweight nature of this, the floor and walls are very thin material. The floor reminds me of one of those really cheap plastic tarps that you can get.<br />The metal stakes that are used to hold in the feet of the poles bend very easily if you hit a rock or an obstacle.<br />Not very secure when set up. I think this would need some serious tent stakes to hold it down in any kind of wind. It was windy here today and I'm not sure this would have stayed together too long.<br />The zippers are not going to take much use, in fact the whole thing might be good for one season of regular camping and use/abuse.<br /><br />All in all, I was hoping for better.

1912,5.0,"Make the fit just perfect with booties and these are great training fins, and certainly perfect for good swimmers snorkeling.","I really wanted to like these SEAC Black (Large 9.5 --11) Fins with the fixed heal strap and open heel. I needed a size 11 short fin for long distance endurance swimming in a harness in my pool year-round. I did not need a fin that was too buoyant and would make me lazy in my kicking.<br /><br />I compared the yellow and black Phantom Aquatics Speed Sport Adjustable Snorkeling Fins L/XL (size 9-13); the US Swim Divers Grey and Black Large Fitness Fins; the black and yellow Cressi Palau Short Snorkeling Fins size LG--XLG; the SEAC Black (Large 9.5 --11) Fins with the fixed heal strap and open heel; and the TYR BP Burner Fins LG (size 11 -- Blue & Black).<br /><br />First off I had to send back the large SEAC's and large TYR EP Burner's to get the XL size in each. Both of them were painfully tight on my size 11 feet.<br /><br />The worst first. The yellow and black Phantom Aquatics Speed Sport Adjustable Snorkeling Fins L/XL (size 9-13) are for snorkeling and not for training of any kind. The boot and heel strap are amazingly comfortable and strong, but the composite fin is too long and whippy for training in either a pool or open water. I would not even want to do kick sets with these.  I personally would not even want to use these for snorkeling because I would always be waiting for the tips of my fins to catch up to what I was trying to do in the water to position myself for snorkeling/sightseeing.<br /><br />The disappointment next. The U.S. Swim Divers Large Fitness Fins had an open heel which I generally prefer because I wear different booties during the 12 months of the year. The length of the boot was perfect, the heel strap was strong, easily adjusted, and comfortable, and the boots felt really comfortable in shape and foot support EXCEPT for the constant pressure on the knuckle of the little toe on each foot.  I'm absolutely a typical size 11, but they hurt my foot, and if you have a slightly thicker or wider size 10.5--11 foot go up to the XL.  I personally didn't order the next size up because while I was kicking with them I could really feel that this fin was not stiff enough for training, and certainly not for kick sets. The rubber fin was bending too easily on every kick at the seam just beyond my toes on both fins - IMOP a serious design flaw for a &#34;fitness fin.&#34; I could never do kick sets in these, but I could use these for snorkeling since the tips of the fins do spring back almost quickly enough to be responsive to my changes in direction and speed.<br /><br />SO COMFORTABLE BUT SO LONG. The black and yellow Cressi Palau Short Snorkeling Fins size LG--XLG had a great shaped boot, a strong and flexible heel strap, and they were absolutely the MOST comfortable boot of all those I tried, BUT these were definitely a better snorkeling fin and/or an open-water training fin. They were absolutely strong enough for open water training (which I rarely get to do anymore), but too way too long for endurance training in a pool with a harness. If these were 2 inches shorter they would have been my overall pick of a stiff training fin.<br /><br />I liked the way the SEAC Black Fins looked, but had to go up to the X-Large (11-12.5) and they were perfect.  They have the fixed heal strap which I usually don't prefer, but this one is strong and stretchy enough to be very comfortable.  The open heel did not make my feet feel unsupported at all. With barefeet they were a little soft, but with a 2mm or 5mm neoprene bootie they fit my feet perfectly. The front of the boot is comfortable lengthwise and widthwise, and there's no unnecessary gimmics in the fin design. As the ad says these are ideal for open water snorkeling for a good swimmer, and ideal for pool training. The fin is short enough and stiff enough for what I wanted to do. I can do flutter kicks or slow subtle kicks just to keep my feet afloat when I am working on my upper body.  The fins do not add any extra buoyancy which I don't need with easy kicking or with a wetsuit on six months of the year. I am so glad I loved these.<br /><br />I just had to try something new with the TYR BP Burner Fins LG (size 11 -- Red & Black).  They had to be exchanged for the XL - the Blue and Black, and I feared they might be too big, but I found they have a very stretchy and supportive heel pocket, that was as comfortable and supportive as the adjustable heel straps I usually prefer. The TYR EP Burners boot will be my spring and summer fins as they fit my naked foot or with a 2mm bootie perfectly.  It's good that the fin is just that short because just another inch or so and the fin would be too flexible.  Perfect design by TYR for a training fin. As the ad says &#34;The perfect fins for training at race cadence.&#34; I kept these for warmer water training and the SEAC's for cold water training.  I would use each of these for snorkeling, as I am a strong swimmer and I want my fins to be very responsive to the demand I am putting on them to change direction or to accelerate and change speed.<br /><br />I was not asked to give this review or compensated by anyone.

1929,3.0,"Difficult to build, and very much temporary","Let me start off by saying it IS functional and we had a blast playing with it at a family get-together once it was up. The problem, however, is that we found it really difficult to follow the directions. That, and I believe there is a design flaw that keeps it from standing very long. I'll get back to that in a moment.<br />For starters, it is pretty much impossible to assemble yourself. You need at least a second person to hold one side in place because nothing will stand until every part is finished (basically, the tension of the net and cords pull against each other and keeps it standing- if one part fails, the whole thing comes down). Second, the instructions are visual with very little printed wording so I found myself constantly staring at the diagram trying to decipher what, exactly, it was telling me to do in this step. I eventually found paragraphs of text in the instruction manual, but they were explaining the rules of volleyball... I'm wondering why they couldn't have spent some of that explaining the setup. Don't get me wrong, I've assembled things from visual instructions without any words before, and sometimes it is really intuitive and creative to do it that way. But this wasn't- it wasn't always clear we were holding the right piece or doing what they were describing to do in that step, and we ended up redoing some of it when we realized we had done it wrong.<br />The good news is that once it is assembled, it not only works great but I'm fairly confident we can put it up again quickly, now that I understand what needs to be done. I guess if you've built a similar net before, perhaps it would be easier to assemble the first time. This was a first time for us, so I guess take that into consideration.<br />Meanwhile, I found a very frustrating problem that I believe to be a design flaw:<br />The screw bolts have a plastic wing fastener on the other end. You heard me right- plastic. See the uploaded image. This is a metal bolt that needs to hold the tension of the ropes to the ground as well as one connection to the net on the other side. So basically, it is being tugged in both directions. It stayed up long enough for an afternoon, but the next day it had come crashing down, the plastic fastener yanked right off, taking the rest of the thing down like dominoes. I put it back up and tried twisting it on more carefully, and within 24 hours it came down again. I wanted it to stay up for the weekend, but it doesn't seem to want to stay up that long. I know it not supposed to be a permanent net, but it's even more temporary than I expected! I eventually used a little metal nut I found in the garage of an appropriate threading size to twist on next to the plastic wingnut and hold it in place, and that seemed to help... until one of the other plastic wingnuts gave out. Right now, as I'm writing this, it is down on the lawn as I'm not even going to attempt putting it back up until I find three more metal nuts to help keep the plastic ones in place.<br />In a nutshell: If you want to play Volleyball for an afternoon, it works well, but you'll need to familiarize yourself with the instructions first and I strongly recommend some metal reinforcements for the wingnuts if you want it to stay up for a weekend. I'd give it another star if those were made of metal instead of plastic.",1,"['let', 'start', 'playing', 'family', 'get', 'together', 'problem', 'however', 'found', 'really', 'difficult', 'direction', 'believe', 'design', 'flaw', 'keep', 'long', 'get', 'back', 'pretty', 'much', 'assemble', 'need', 'least', 'second', 'person', 'hold', 'one', 'side', 'place', 'nothing', 'stand', 'every', 'part', 'basically', 'tension', 'net', 'cord', 'pull', 'keep', 'one', 'part', 'whole', 'thing', 'come', 'second', 'instruction', 'little', 'found', 'trying', 'exactly', 'step', 'found', 'instruction', 'spent', 'get', 'wrong', 'assembled', 'thing', 'instruction', 'without', 'sometimes', 'really', 'way', 'always', 'clear', 'holding', 'right', 'piece', 'step', 'ended', 'done', 'wrong', 'good', 'assembled', 'work', 'great', 'fairly', 'put', 'quickly', 'understand', 'need', 'done', 'guess', 'built', 'similar', 'net', 'perhaps', 'easier', 'assemble', 'first', 'time', 'first', 'time', 'guess', 'take', 'found', 'problem', 'believe', 'design', 'flaw', 'screw', 'bolt', 'plastic', 'end', 'right', 'plastic', 'see', 'metal', 'bolt', 'need', 'hold', 'tension', 'rope', 'ground', 'well', 'one', 'net', 'side', 'basically', 'direction', 'long', 'enough', 'next', 'day', 'come', 'plastic', 'right', 'taking', 'rest', 'thing', 'like', 'put', 'back', 'tried', 'within', 'hour', 'came', 'wanted', 'stay', 'doe', 'seem', 'want', 'stay', 'long', 'know', 'supposed', 'net', 'even', 'expected', 'used', 'little', 'metal', 'found', 'garage', 'size', 'twist', 'next', 'plastic', 'hold', 'place', 'seemed', 'help', 'one', 'plastic', 'gave', 'right', 'even', 'going', 'putting', 'back', 'find', 'three', 'metal', 'help', 'keep', 'plastic', 'one', 'place', 'want', 'play', 'work', 'well', 'need', 'instruction', 'first', 'recommend', 'metal', 'want', 'stay', 'give', 'another', 'star', 'made', 'metal', 'instead', 'plastic']"

1941,3.0,Warm but heavy woman's sleeping bag at almost 7 pounds,"This is my sixth sleeping bag. I had two cheap bags when I was a teenager which I wore out when I use to go ""open-sky"" camping and backpacking. I then owned an expensive -15 degree Kelty down mummy sack which I absolutely loved until the zipper broke after several uses and which I returned for a refund.  As a replacement, I purchased two [[ASIN:B0007IS68I Columbia Elkhorn II Rectangular Sleeping Bags with Pillow]]  which I still have.  I decided to see if there was a better one out there in the reasonably priced category. This is why I selected this one for review.<br /><br />Therefore, I compared this Slumberjack Women's bag with the Columbia bag I love which has a snag-free zipper, a soft flannel inside, an integrated pillow and carry sack, weighs 4 pounds, measures the typical 80 x 34 inches, and is rated up to 25 degrees all for a reasonable price.<br /><br />In comparison, this Slumberjack's features are:<br />* Temperature rating up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit or -7 degrees Celsius<br />* Carry weight is 6 lbs 10 oz<br />* Fits women up to 6 feet tall (it's 80"" x 34"")<br />* It comes with a pillow pocket and a stuff sack<br />* The inside is soft-touch polyester<br />* It is designed for women (PS I have no idea how that differs from a generic sleeping bag as the size looks like a man's to me and is the same size as my Columbia and the color is not feminine.)<br /><br />LIKES:<br />- It feels warm and is roomy.<br />- The pillow pocket is a nice touch.<br />- The Velcro over the top of the zipper channel keeps the drafts away.<br />- The rectangular construction allows for two of these bags to be zipped together.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />- The sleeping bag is heavy at almost 7 pounds (my Columbia is 4 pounds which I also consider heavy). I would not want to take this backpacking.<br />- It does not come with a pillow as there's only a pocket for one. The pocket does not function as a pillow unless stuffed with something.<br />- I was unable to roll this back into the stuff sack; instead I had to manhandle it into the sack any way I could. I think this must have been machine packed into the sack.<br />- I prefer a flannel inside to this polyester.<br />- The zipper snags easily unless I put my finger in the track to keep it away from the lining.  This is typical of many bags so it's almost a non-issue.<br /><br />In summary, unless you are backpacking and need a lighter sack, I think this is a good bag for the price even though it does not have all the features of my Columbia.  Personally, I prefer mummy sacks for the warmth and coziness; however, I would still choose my Columbia Elkhorn II over this Slumberjack. I cannot recommend this for backpacking, but where weight doesn't matter such as when camping or having a slumber party in the house or yard, then this bag is a viable contender.",1,"['sleeping', 'bag', 'two', 'cheap', 'bag', 'use', 'open', 'camping', 'backpacking', 'expensive', 'degree', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'zipper', 'broke', 'several', 'returned', 'refund', 'replacement', 'purchased', 'two', 'asin', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'pillow', 'still', 'decided', 'see', 'better', 'one', 'priced', 'one', 'review', 'compared', 'woman', 'bag', 'bag', 'love', 'free', 'zipper', 'soft', 'inside', 'pillow', 'carry', 'pound', 'typical', 'inch', 'degree', 'price', 'feature', 'rating', 'degree', 'degree', 'carry', 'weight', 'fit', 'woman', 'foot', 'tall', 'come', 'pillow', 'pocket', 'stuff', 'inside', 'soft', 'touch', 'designed', 'woman', 'idea', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'size', 'look', 'like', 'size', 'color', 'like', 'feel', 'warm', 'pillow', 'pocket', 'nice', 'touch', 'velcro', 'top', 'zipper', 'keep', 'away', 'construction', 'allows', 'two', 'bag', 'together', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'heavy', 'almost', 'pound', 'pound', 'also', 'consider', 'heavy', 'want', 'take', 'backpacking', 'doe', 'come', 'pillow', 'pocket', 'one', 'pocket', 'doe', 'function', 'pillow', 'unless', 'something', 'roll', 'back', 'stuff', 'instead', 'way', 'think', 'must', 'machine', 'prefer', 'inside', 'zipper', 'easily', 'unless', 'put', 'finger', 'track', 'keep', 'away', 'typical', 'many', 'bag', 'almost', 'non', 'issue', 'unless', 'backpacking', 'need', 'lighter', 'think', 'good', 'bag', 'price', 'even', 'though', 'doe', 'feature', 'personally', 'prefer', 'however', 'still', 'recommend', 'backpacking', 'weight', 'doe', 'matter', 'camping', 'house', 'yard', 'bag']"

1944,5.0,"Perfect for camping, hiking and biking","This bottle is a perfect companion for me when I am performing on stage, and especially in hot venues. It's also ideal for the activities I put in the title. Note: I received this as a review sample.<br /><br />Here are some observations. First, while this can hold hot liquids thanks to the silicone sealing ring in the cap, I recommend against it. I tested this with hot coffee and two things happened. First, it was too hot to hold for about ten minutes, and second, it rapidly cooled due to the thin walls and the large surface area that promotes heat transfer.<br /><br />Because this is thin-walled it will not keep liquids cold for long either, One workaround is to fill it a quarter the way with ice, then your beverage or water. It will maintain coolness for about 90 minutes unless you are in a truly hot place. It will also sweat, so take that into account.<br /><br />The reason why I think it's perfect is capacity. That, coupled with a surprisingly indestructible exterior (I would have never guessed that such a thin vessel would take the knocks it does without denting), and leak proof cap make it ideal for outdoors activities.<br /><br />There is one characteristic that some folks will find useful: this is made from the non-magnetic variety of stainless steel. If you are in an environment or performing an activity where non-magnetic objects are required, this one will be acceptable.<br /><br />For me the lack of thermal qualities is not a detriment because I use it mainly for rehydrating and I prefer to drink water at room temperature.<br /><br />A final note: this is a hand wash only bottle that is NOT dishwasher safe. Also, if you are using it for citrus-based drinks the interior may discolor.

1982,5.0,"Attractive, sustainable & does what it promises, but too large for me","I wanted a larger water bottle for use at my workplace because I found that I was running low on water too often and was too busy (or, admittedly, too lazy) to take the 2 minute walk to refill my water bottle, leaving myself thirsty and dehydrated at my desk for hours.  In doing my research for a worthy substitute, I was really attracted to this water bottle.  I loved the company's sustainable values and how well-made their product seemed.<br /><br />When I received the water bottle, I was surprised how lightweight on it is on its own; of course, it gets heavy when you fill it with 40 oz of water, which I wish that I had the foresight to realize before I made this purchase.  It is so heavy and wide that I need to use two hands to pick up and drink out of when it is full.  The other noticeable thing about the bottle is its beautiful color.  I bought it in aqua and it is so eye-catching that I got two compliments on it in my small office during its first day of use.<br /><br />I did not like the style of the cap which the water bottle came with, so after doing research, I purchased another brand's water bottle cap which was HydroFlask-compatible, which I also thought should be compatible with this one.  Unfortunately, it is not.  The cap screws on, but it leaks.  Of course, this is not the fault of the brand or the water bottle, but it was disappointing to me, and if you are considering buying the bottle and swapping out the cap, this might be worth taking note of.<br /><br />When I first bought this water bottle, I intended to use it all the time to replace my current water bottle.  However, due to its hefty size and weight, I have decided to keep this bottle strictly at the office, as it is even too heavy and unwieldy to bring back and forth to my car, gym, and/or home.  I drive a little sedan and it does not fit in my cup holders.  I might be bringing it to the gym on my heavy cardio evenings, but it definitely staying in the office for pilates and barre.  And it is definitely useful to have around for camping or hiking!<br /><br />Overall great water bottle and very pleased with the product; unsure how practical it is for daily hydration use when commuting (unless you commute with a backpack).",0,"['wanted', 'larger', 'water', 'bottle', 'use', 'found', 'running', 'low', 'water', 'often', 'take', 'minute', 'walk', 'water', 'bottle', 'desk', 'hour', 'really', 'water', 'bottle', 'loved', 'company', 'value', 'well', 'made', 'product', 'seemed', 'received', 'water', 'bottle', 'surprised', 'lightweight', 'course', 'get', 'heavy', 'fill', 'water', 'wish', 'made', 'purchase', 'heavy', 'wide', 'need', 'use', 'two', 'hand', 'drink', 'full', 'thing', 'bottle', 'beautiful', 'color', 'bought', 'eye', 'got', 'two', 'small', 'first', 'day', 'use', 'like', 'style', 'cap', 'water', 'bottle', 'came', 'purchased', 'another', 'brand', 'water', 'bottle', 'cap', 'also', 'thought', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'cap', 'screw', 'leak', 'course', 'brand', 'water', 'bottle', 'disappointing', 'buying', 'bottle', 'cap', 'might', 'worth', 'taking', 'note', 'first', 'bought', 'water', 'bottle', 'intended', 'use', 'time', 'replace', 'current', 'water', 'bottle', 'however', 'due', 'size', 'weight', 'decided', 'keep', 'bottle', 'even', 'heavy', 'back', 'car', 'gym', 'home', 'little', 'doe', 'fit', 'cup', 'holder', 'might', 'gym', 'heavy', 'definitely', 'definitely', 'useful', 'around', 'camping', 'hiking', 'overall', 'great', 'water', 'bottle', 'pleased', 'product', 'daily', 'use', 'unless', 'backpack']"

2003,5.0,Moving Away From Mono,"I have been a nylon monofilament guy for years. I tried Spiderwire as an experiment and truly hated it and quickly went back to mono, happy and content with it. I was not familiar with copolymer line and was provided some for testing. It has changed my opinion of mono.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have had with mono is that it is prone to memory (retaining the coil from the spindle on which it is spooled). Cast out and you get a plastic spring on the water. It doesn’t really hurt anything until you try to reel it in quickly with no load, and then you get a “rat’s nest” on the spool. I have not had this line long enough to tell if this is going to be a problem, but I have seen some other benefits.<br /><br />Compared to the same lb-test line, this copolymer line is slightly more limber and flexible. I never realized that monofilament is actually somewhat stiff - well, it’s stiff in comparison to the copolymer line, anyway.<br /><br />Something else I noticed about this line is that it is less likely to kink and snag in use. Monofilament has a bad tendency to get cuts and abrasions in it and I always assumed this was just part of the price one pays for the pleasure of fishing. I was startled to find that this doesn’t have to be the case. As a test I grabbed a phillips screwdriver and pressed the bit of it at an angle  against a strand of monofilament line and made an indentation. I did the same to the copolymer line and was surprised that the copolymer did not retain any misshapenness and did not show any signs of cuts. The monofilament showed a very small imperfection in the line where I pressed the screwdriver. Cuts in a line, even small ones, are often the difference between a catch and losing a good fish, and I am encouraged by the copolymer’s ability to be a little more resistant to damage.<br /><br />I have the green copolymer and it blends in nicely into the water.<br /><br />In casting the copolymer line peels off the reel very smoothly and with a good reel I get excellent casting distance. I don’t see too much difference between the copolymer and the monofilament when casting.<br /><br />I never considered anything other than monofilament before now.

2004,1.0,A little thicker than its shrink-wrap and about as durable,"Bought this to replace a similar off-brand mat that had seen near daily use under my cycling trainer setup.

2024,3.0,Good but not great,[[VIDEOID:4d45ab704c75cc475e463916ef70dbe2]] I picked this up I’m hopes I’d get to do some camping this year. I figured having a camping “stove” was a good idea to have. Overall this thing is a great size if you want to cook more substantial food or have bigger camping pots/pans. It’s not super light and there’s other options for camping “stoves” but nothing this is great if you have bigger pots/pans.<br /><br />The cons however this thing is covered in blue film. It’s legit everywhere on the product and it’s a bitch to get enough of it off to feel confident that it won’t somehow end up in/on your food while cooking.<br /><br />I suggest giving it a good test run by burning some wood to burn off and excess plastic film BEFORE you decide to cook with it. All in all it’s good but not great. If you’re looking for super lightweight backing type stoves this isn’t for you.

That is when I made purchase of the worthwhile addition of the padded bucket lid. For ten bucks, you get a securely fitting bucket lid that doubles as a decent seat.

2027,4.0,Very Capable and Feature Rich; Not Right For Everyone,"I have worked with other smart watches that monitor health. I have also worked with other Nokia products in the past. Because of my past experiences with Nokia, I had high expectations for this watch. So far, I have not been disappointed with it.<br /><br />I will start by saying this - this is a sleek, streamlined and clean-looking watch that is very aesthetically pleasant. It is very uncluttered and it simple and straightforward to read. I like that and am pleased with the overall presentation. Some smart watches, and in particular health monitor ones, are very cluttered and busy-looking, but this one keeps the display very conservative and clean. The numbers are on the outside border of the face which makes it a little tougher to read the current time but this is a minor point and contributes to the clean face.<br /><br />The charger is a little better than average and I like it. Some watches I have used have a simple magnetic disk with no pins or contacts, just a wireless solution that easily slides off. I have not had that issue with this watch so far.<br /><br />To get the most from this watch you need to download an app from either Apple or Google. The app gives access to the various functions on the watch and allows you to monitor and track progress. In playing with the iOS version, it seems to be a bit more complete and useful than a lot of other monitoring apps I have seen and used,<br /><br />Setup takes a little time. After downloading the app, the app assisted in pairing the watch ot my phone, then it sent a updates to it. The while process was 10-15 minutes, mostly painless but taking some time.<br /><br />There are a lot of functions this watch/app provides. The most obvious is a heart rate monitor, but it also is able to monitor steps, sleep cycles and more. Being a poor sleeper who wakes up repeatedly in the night, I am most interested in the sleep tracker which is a tool I have not had access to in other watches, I am still learning how to use it, but it’s working for me so far.<br /><br />Now, all that said, I had some trouble getting it to read my heart rate accurately. My resting heart rate is usually around 80 bpm. The monitor said I was averaging below 70 bpm. The only way I was able to get it to read my heart rate accurately was to flip the watch around so that the sensor touched the palm-side of my wrist. That’s ok as it is a work-around that allows the unit to work more accurately for me, but it is an unnatural way for me to wear a watch.<br /><br />The band is a downside for me - I am not a fan of rubber wrist bands. It is designed for the physically active person, not someone who putters around an office all day, so this is a case of the band not matching my day-to-day use. The band pulls a bit and is uncomfortable. When I have the chance I likely will replace it with something more comfortable. On the plus side, the band is big enough to fit an elephant, so I have no issues getting it to clasp with room to spare.<br /><br />Another concern for me is the size of the watch itself. I personally prefer a larger watch, and this one is smaller. Again, for active people or for people with smaller wrists this is much more preferable. This is not a problem with the watch, it’s my personal preferences.<br /><br />The battery is a huge plus. It lasts weeks, not hours or days, so when traveling you do not need to take your charger with you unless you’re going to be gone a month or more. Keep this in mind.<br /><br />So far I haven’t had any real problems with the watch other than having to adjust how I wear it and personal preference issues. It seems to be very capable, it has a lot of features and the software is very straightforward and easy to understand.",0,"['worked', 'watch', 'monitor', 'also', 'worked', 'product', 'past', 'past', 'experience', 'high', 'watch', 'far', 'disappointed', 'start', 'clean', 'looking', 'watch', 'simple', 'read', 'like', 'pleased', 'overall', 'watch', 'monitor', 'one', 'looking', 'one', 'keep', 'display', 'clean', 'number', 'outside', 'face', 'make', 'little', 'read', 'current', 'time', 'point', 'clean', 'face', 'charger', 'little', 'better', 'average', 'like', 'watch', 'used', 'simple', 'pin', 'contact', 'easily', 'slide', 'issue', 'watch', 'far', 'get', 'watch', 'need', 'app', 'either', 'app', 'give', 'various', 'function', 'watch', 'allows', 'monitor', 'track', 'playing', 'version', 'seems', 'bit', 'complete', 'useful', 'lot', 'seen', 'used', 'take', 'little', 'time', 'app', 'app', 'watch', 'phone', 'sent', 'update', 'minute', 'mostly', 'taking', 'time', 'lot', 'function', 'watch', 'app', 'provides', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'also', 'able', 'monitor', 'step', 'sleep', 'poor', 'night', 'sleep', 'tool', 'watch', 'still', 'use', 'working', 'far', 'said', 'trouble', 'getting', 'read', 'heart', 'rate', 'heart', 'rate', 'usually', 'around', 'monitor', 'said', 'way', 'able', 'get', 'read', 'heart', 'rate', 'watch', 'around', 'side', 'wrist', 'work', 'around', 'allows', 'unit', 'work', 'way', 'wear', 'watch', 'band', 'fan', 'rubber', 'wrist', 'band', 'designed', 'active', 'person', 'someone', 'around', 'day', 'case', 'band', 'day', 'day', 'use', 'band', 'pull', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'chance', 'likely', 'replace', 'something', 'comfortable', 'plus', 'side', 'band', 'big', 'enough', 'fit', 'issue', 'getting', 'room', 'another', 'concern', 'size', 'watch', 'personally', 'prefer', 'larger', 'watch', 'one', 'smaller', 'active', 'people', 'people', 'smaller', 'wrist', 'much', 'problem', 'watch', 'battery', 'huge', 'plus', 'last', 'week', 'hour', 'day', 'need', 'take', 'charger', 'unless', 'going', 'month', 'keep', 'mind', 'far', 'real', 'problem', 'watch', 'adjust', 'wear', 'issue', 'seems', 'lot', 'feature', 'easy', 'understand']"

2080,3.0,Well-padded lifting gloves that are a bit cumbersome to fasten,"I have owned a pair of  Lee Haney lifting gloves with wrist wrap for 19 years and which I used three times per week for about 12 of those years.  I still have those gloves and although they are a bit stiff, you'd never know they were used so much as they hardly look worn.  Since the Lee Haney gloves are not padded, I decided to try these gloves both because I expected an increase in comfort and as an enticement to get me back into lifting again.<br /><br />The gloves I received are a size ""Large"" and they are heavier than any other lifting gloves I've tried before; the pair weighs in at 6.2 ounces according to my dietary food scale.  However, you don't notice the weight when wearing them.  Below are the pros and cons I noticed during use:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. The gloves are well padded.  In fact, the padding is an excellent feature for when I perform lifts where the weight is in the palm of my hand, such as when doing a bench press or incline press or when the weight is evenly distributed throughout the hand such as when doing squats using a [[ASIN:B0000AVAL2 Advanced Fitness Manta Ray]].<br /><br />2. I usually take a size medium or large in a woman's glove and this size large fit me comfortably.<br /><br />3. The extra ""leather-like"" flap that you secure to the fastened wrist wrap offers extra security so that the wrap won't come undone during a lift and the gloves will remain securely fastened.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. The padding on the pinkie finger was uncomfortable for me when doing dead lifts because the bar was evenly distributed through my hand and the padding on the pinkie finger seemed to get in the way.  It almost caused a pressure point of discomfort during each entire lift (ascent and descent).<br /><br />2. The wrist wrap was awkward to fasten because not only did I have to wrap the strap around my wrist, but then I had to flip over the ""leather-like"" flap and make sure it fastened to the Velcro on the back of the flap.<br /><br />3. I was bothered by the white tag inside the right glove during lifting.  Perhaps the manufacturer could either leave the tags out or put them on the non-Velcro portion of the wrist wrap.<br /><br />4. I don't like that the two pieces of fabric used to fasten the glove to the cardboard insert it came with remain sewed to the glove.  Basically, the gloves arrive with two tags on each glove that fastens to the cardboard packaging. Those tags remain as part of the glove and to me they are annoying as I see no reason to ever use those tags again.<br /><br />I do think that if men are considering purchasing these gloves, they might want to consider ordering the next size up.  My boyfriend always takes a size ""Large"" in men's gloves and he had to struggle to get these size Large gloves on his hands.<br /><br />These gloves are thick and although they feel well-made they don't look well-made on close inspection. Therefore, I'm concerned that the stitching on the padding may come loose.  When comparing these gloves to my Lee Haney gloves, I doubt they will last as long but only time will tell.<br /><br />If padding is important, then these gloves offer that and certainly cushion the lifter during many lifts. However, for me I can only give these gloves an average rating because of the cons and my concern that the stitching around the padding will come loose.",1,"['pair', 'glove', 'wrist', 'wrap', 'year', 'used', 'three', 'time', 'per', 'week', 'year', 'still', 'glove', 'although', 'bit', 'stiff', 'never', 'know', 'used', 'much', 'look', 'worn', 'since', 'glove', 'decided', 'try', 'glove', 'expected', 'comfort', 'get', 'back', 'glove', 'received', 'size', 'large', 'heavier', 'glove', 'tried', 'pair', 'food', 'however', 'notice', 'weight', 'wearing', 'pro', 'con', 'noticed', 'use', 'pro', 'glove', 'well', 'fact', 'padding', 'excellent', 'feature', 'lift', 'weight', 'hand', 'bench', 'press', 'press', 'weight', 'hand', 'using', 'asin', 'fitness', 'usually', 'take', 'size', 'medium', 'large', 'woman', 'glove', 'size', 'large', 'fit', 'comfortably', 'extra', 'like', 'secure', 'wrist', 'wrap', 'offer', 'extra', 'wrap', 'come', 'lift', 'glove', 'securely', 'con', 'padding', 'finger', 'uncomfortable', 'lift', 'bar', 'hand', 'padding', 'finger', 'seemed', 'get', 'way', 'almost', 'pressure', 'point', 'entire', 'lift', 'wrist', 'wrap', 'wrap', 'strap', 'around', 'wrist', 'like', 'make', 'sure', 'velcro', 'back', 'white', 'inside', 'right', 'glove', 'perhaps', 'manufacturer', 'either', 'leave', 'put', 'non', 'velcro', 'wrist', 'wrap', 'like', 'two', 'piece', 'fabric', 'used', 'glove', 'insert', 'came', 'glove', 'basically', 'glove', 'two', 'glove', 'part', 'glove', 'annoying', 'see', 'reason', 'ever', 'use', 'think', 'glove', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'next', 'size', 'always', 'take', 'size', 'large', 'glove', 'get', 'size', 'large', 'glove', 'hand', 'glove', 'thick', 'although', 'feel', 'well', 'made', 'look', 'well', 'made', 'close', 'stitching', 'padding', 'may', 'come', 'loose', 'glove', 'glove', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'tell', 'padding', 'important', 'glove', 'offer', 'certainly', 'cushion', 'many', 'lift', 'however', 'give', 'glove', 'average', 'rating', 'con', 'concern', 'stitching', 'around', 'padding', 'come', 'loose']"

2083,5.0,I Bought This Gorgeous Brand New Down Coat- Then The Cat..,"It is very hard to find affordable down coats and jackets of late.  Finding one that is genuine down, has fantastic fabric and is made well is, well, almost beyond my ability.  Then I found this amazing gorgeous turquoise down jacket which is the perfect jacket.  Lightweight, warm, and SO pretty.  I put my jacket down for a moment to go get something and our cat decided to jump on the jacket.  When it slid, the claws came out, and well, there was crying, screaming, and flying cats involved.<br /><br />THAT is where this kit comes in.  Let's talk about it..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS KIT LIKE?<br />First of all this kit comes wrapped in a cardboard wrap that is heavy duty.  It folds up to go inside the zippered bag inside the package.  The package comes with all that is in the description.  It is easy to store, easy to backpack with, and very HANDY to have.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS WORK?<br />First of all, my coat is almost a teflon type nylon.  Literally nothing sticks to it.  That means that the small slashes in the coat where the down is poking out will not sustain either glue or thread- the weave is WAY too tight. It would ruin it.  I was so happy to find this kit and truly put it to the test.<br /><br />APPLICATION ON THE COAT<br />This is quite easy to apply.  You have to poke a hole in the tube as the cap does not have that feature like most things of this nature do.  That is one drawback.  However, once the tube is pierced, you smear the clear thick liquid around the tear and just beyond, trying to hold the edges together as much as you can for small tears/holes.<br /><br />HOW LONG TO WAIT?<br />I tried two types of patches with this.  I did just the holes with the liquid sealant itself and then one longer slash with a clear patch cut down to size.  In both cases it took about 24 hours or so to set, although I could WEAR the jacket with the patch on it, but washing will not work.  It has to wait a week or so to truly set before washing.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT CAMPING GEAR?<br />Well, if you are out in the elements and need to use this, it should perform fine.  The patches will set and the alcohol pads that come with the kit will enable you to clean off the fabric.  If it is wet, I would not try this, but it if is dry, this should work fine.  If you use a patch, rain will bead off of the surface.  You can also use the patches underneath and peel them away once the sealant is set.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />In my case, this did seal my coat beautifully.  Unfortnately now my gorgeous coat is covered with clear shiny spots everywhere, but it still works and I can wear it in spite of the shiny spots.  It has held together so far, but I will have to wash my coat soon so if anything happens this time around, I will update.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This actually sticks to my coat that NOTHING will stick to.  That is a huge relief.  I love my coat.  At least I can wear it spots and all.",0,"['hard', 'find', 'jacket', 'one', 'fabric', 'made', 'well', 'well', 'almost', 'ability', 'found', 'amazing', 'jacket', 'perfect', 'jacket', 'lightweight', 'warm', 'pretty', 'put', 'jacket', 'get', 'something', 'decided', 'jump', 'jacket', 'came', 'well', 'kit', 'come', 'let', 'kit', 'like', 'first', 'kit', 'come', 'wrap', 'heavy', 'duty', 'fold', 'inside', 'bag', 'inside', 'package', 'package', 'come', 'description', 'easy', 'store', 'easy', 'backpack', 'handy', 'doe', 'work', 'first', 'almost', 'type', 'literally', 'nothing', 'stick', 'mean', 'small', 'either', 'thread', 'way', 'tight', 'happy', 'find', 'kit', 'put', 'test', 'quite', 'easy', 'hole', 'tube', 'cap', 'doe', 'feature', 'like', 'thing', 'one', 'however', 'tube', 'clear', 'thick', 'liquid', 'around', 'trying', 'hold', 'edge', 'together', 'much', 'small', 'hole', 'long', 'wait', 'tried', 'two', 'type', 'hole', 'liquid', 'one', 'longer', 'clear', 'cut', 'size', 'case', 'took', 'hour', 'set', 'although', 'wear', 'jacket', 'washing', 'work', 'wait', 'week', 'set', 'washing', 'camping', 'gear', 'well', 'need', 'use', 'fine', 'set', 'pad', 'come', 'kit', 'clean', 'fabric', 'wet', 'try', 'dry', 'work', 'fine', 'use', 'rain', 'surface', 'also', 'use', 'underneath', 'away', 'set', 'bottom', 'line', 'case', 'seal', 'clear', 'spot', 'still', 'work', 'wear', 'spot', 'held', 'together', 'far', 'wash', 'soon', 'anything', 'time', 'around', 'update', 'rating', 'five', 'star', 'actually', 'stick', 'nothing', 'stick', 'huge', 'love', 'least', 'wear', 'spot']"

2102,3.0,"Step 1, Crack a cold one","You bought a golf cart, but you need that rear seat. You see this listing on Amazon and can't wait for it to arrive. The good news is that it arrives fairly quickly and in pristine packaging, excellent. There are 2 boxes, one has the structural components, the other has the pads... sure.<br />You open box 1 for all of the structural components to be laid out and to get your project started. No sense getting the seat pads dirty so you leave box 2 sealed up. After separately out the somewhat accurately described bolt kit labels, you decide to get started. Removing the old pieces from your cart is somewhat of a detailed process and is mostly accurate. DO save all of those pieces just in case (pro tip, there will be a just in case).<br />You've got the cart in the state it needs to be to begin your assembly. As you begin to use the available bolts you start to loosely piece this thing together so sooner or later it looks like a cart seat. The problem here is that several bolts are not found, you need to open box 2 to find those because they are in there when it was close to 5 o'clock on a Friday and that box wasn't sealed before heading out the door at the Modz warehouse.<br />Anyways, you've now probably got all your nuts and bolts for the cart and a few have loosened up inside your head trying to figure this out. Most of the pieces will line up properly, though attaching the post to the old seat back slot might not work because they weren't fully drilled out like mine. This is where the old bolts come into play (that's not on Modz though).<br />You are loosely assembling most of the pieces only to find out that the bolts they provided are kind of accurately labeled for proper measurements. It would've been better to just use a metric ruler though because some bolts ended up where they didn't below. The good news is that you've got some extra bolts you didn't use because you used some of the old bolts. Unfortunately, those are the shortest bolts of the kit so you can't use them anyways. Now you've got some sick spare bolts for some future project that may or may not require them.<br />Once you go to attach the arm rest to the base of the cart you realize the available bolts will be too long so you can't properly open up the seat to turn into a flat bed. This is where the extra washers come into play (don't worry there's somewhere between 10-67 extra washers) so you can shore up the bolt head so there's less available thread on the end. This helps make sure that the bed opens up properly because you are about ready to lay down anyways. The rest of the assembly goes fairly smooth, though getting the seat back supports off the old Club Car DS is super fun since the nut is buried inside of a channel where only a small team of your kids' GI Joe's tools could fit. Once you've turned into Superman to bend that aluminum enough to gap and get the bolt head secure and the incredibly precise angle of your pliers to free up that seatback support you are home free.<br />From there it's only a few more screws before you are done with a project that you estimated to take about 45 minutes lasted nearly 3 hours.<br />Cheers!

While it could be used more than once, it is really one of those things that are a one and done sort of thing (it will never fold back down small). It is the typical long tube. It includes a length of very basic cordage. I prefer a more robust paracord, so if you have that, maybe use it instead. The added length of the tent is to allow it to keep out the elements and to be able to scrunch it it in. Perfect for keeping gear at one end, and exit/entry point at the other.

2108,5.0,Amazing improvement!,"Two months ago, I had a custom saddle built on an existing 50 year old mesquite tree. (I found the tree in Mexico in perfect condition) This has been an amazing process and the saddle is 90% perfect. My issue was the new stirrups and leather fenders....so stiff and that equates to knee and ankle pain trying to break everything in over time.<br /><br />These stirrup turners were EXACTLY what I needed. Holy cow! Immediate comfort and correct placement. They do add length so you definitely need to adjust your stirrups. I ended up going up three holes for proper leg placement after adding these. Fortunately, my saddle maker measured my short legs and added extra holes to compensate.<br /><br />The addition of these turners means I can mount safely from anywhere and instantly find my right stirrup without looking. The stirrups stay in the correct angle and are balanced even on rough, steep mountain trails. That's a big deal out in the Big Bend desert mountains of West Texas. Installation was quite simple and took just a few minutes. My only complaint is because these are so thick and stiff (they have to be) my ankles can take a beating after several hours on the trails.

2128,5.0,Ridiculously Big Water Bottle Doesn't Need Frequent Refills!,"I love this ridiculously big POLAR BOTTLE &quot;BLUE BIG BEAR&quot; 42-OUNCE INSULATED WATER BOTTLE!  It's easy to grip, even when filled with water and ice, because of the pinched &quot;waist&quot; in the middle.  The wide mouth allows you to drop in (rather than squeeze in) whole ice cubes, which makes filling the bottle frustration-free.  It has a spill-resistant squeeze top that is easy to open and to drink from. (The valve is removable for thorough cleaning, as desired.)<br /><br />What I needed was a really big water bottle to keep by my TV-watching chair.  With this one, I can fill it daily with filtered tap water, and never need to refill it during my evening programs. It's big, but it fits under the kitchen faucet (when held at an angle).  The bottle has a carrying ring that makes it easy to transport around the house.<br /><br />My &quot;Blue Big Bear&quot; bottle doesn't look quite as good as the product photo.  The graphic is printed on a slightly crumpled liner that's inside a cloudy plastic exterior.  Thus it takes good light at the correct angle for the graphic to show up well, and for the bottle to look really blue.

I am also looking at the Physique 57 training that is pilates centric too, that creates a leaner look and weight loss too!<br /><br />This pack includes:"" the core trainer, a dvd that has 45 minutes and an 30 minutes express plus focus on core training; a set of cards for 8 workouts to focus on lower body, upper body, core and stretch/renew; a food diary; recipes and workout chart!  That is a lot of goodies and use what your level of knowledge and guidance needed.<br /><br />Workout: very effective and I love that fact it is low impact and I had a great work out.  I Love running, spinning and various workouts, but wanted something that is low impact with pilates that is core focused.  Instructions on the DVD is very good with one person who focuses on modifications if you are still building your reflexibility and cardio.  There are three level of resistances that you can work up to, and for me, I am generally weak on my upper body and this workout will really make me focus on this area, whether i like it or not!  The workout works out both core, heart and strength training!  3 in 1!<br /><br />There are not a lot of extra dvds with this tool: 2 so far, so it will be good if they can provide a few more for people like who needs a lot of variety when working out.

There is a metal attachment between the lid and the handle, however, that may well succumb to use before the rest of the assemblage.  It is a clip that can be widened ‘narrowed as needed to close pot properly.

2189,4.0,Great Addition to Our Exercise Room!,"My husband and I have been doing Weight Watchers this year and were very excited to get this for indoor exercise. As far as putting it together, it wasn't too difficult for my husband. If you have never assembled things like this, it may be more challenging.  It does come with a little &#34;L&#34; wrench, but fortunately my husband has a couple of hex wrench sets that he was able to use which sped up the assembly. He put most of it together in the living room and then when he had the two halves of it (front and back), he carried them down to the basement where we are going to keep it to finish. Our bike did come with two left handles. There was a sheet inside the box that said if you are missing any pieces, contact them instead of the store where you purchased it. In our experience, it's not that uncommon to have an incorrect or missing piece. I immediately e-mailed the company and they shipped out the new handle. This was actually a lot easier to get the missing piece than it is with some of furniture that we have had to put together in the past! The bike works quite well. My husband has been using it almost every morning. The seat is not very comfortable, but we have found that to be the case with other exercise equipment. I put a small pillow behind my back when I'm riding it and that improves that a lot. After reading some of the other reviews, I expected it to be really noisy and loud, but it's not at all. My husband was using his own bike on a stand to keep it in place and this is not much louder or noisier than that. It's also a little quieter than our treadmill. We don't have to turn the TV up too loud for it to be heard while using it.  There are a few different levels of resistance and it is pretty easy to change those for your workout.

2199,5.0,"Perfect fit, thin, rugged built. Read full review for details","Update, used with my Kenia 65 cooler other day,  it worked wonders,  as the cheap ice I used started to melt this divider helped to refreeze the ice on the bottom of cooler.  This helped make my ice last even longer.  After 4 days of use it finally thawed.  I did how ever notice it didnt seal to bottom of cooler.  Meaning water will get to the other side as ice melts.  So if your using the divider for dry side wet side it isnt going to work.  You will have to make some type of seal between the two sides to have any chance of keeping 1 side dry.<br />But if your using just to help ice stay froze longer this is so perfect for that use.<br /><br />I love my cooler and it will pay for itself within 40 days of using just off the ice savings.<br /><br />This worked perfectly for my new 65 quart Kenai Cooler..  apperently the Grizzley Company owns Kenai as well judging by the pamphlet provided with cooler, so there wasnt much research needed to find one to fit.<br /><br />There is a few lbs of weight (unfrozen) for it to be less then an inch thick, it's also very rugged,  I'm sure it could take a drop or two and shouldnt have any issues.  It fit perfectly inside the center divider groove and has about 1.5"" left from top inside lip.<br />There is a drain plug on the ice pack for replacement liquid.  The pack is thin enough it will freeze pretty quick but it does have some size to it so freezer space may or could be an issue.  This will help to precool your cooler before use so you can get the maximum duration of chill out of you high dollar purchase and use it to keep you cup ice seperate from chilling ice that hands, cans touch everytime its opened.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful, please vote, so Amazonian browsers can better learn, research and understand how products work for them.!.

2204,5.0,This table may be tiny standing 15 inches tall but it is well-designed & versatile for many uses as a side table or stool,"This is a very tiny table that stands 15 inches tall when fully opened (17 inches when closed) and stands a few inches below my knee. The table/stool has a small 10 inch by 12 inch surface area. It is designed for use when sitting in a low camp chair. This is also  very light and easy to carry when folded because the frame acts as a handle. What I particularly love about this tiny side table is that it opens and closes easily but is structurally sound when in either position. I own a full-sized plastic table that is designed to open and close the same way but dangerously collapses at the slightest touch. This table does not do that because it sort of locks in place. It also appears to be made of aluminum.<br /><br />I purchased this to use as a small table for my balcony for plants and for use as a temporary table to lay books or other items next to me when I am sitting at my desk. I love that it folds down thin enough that I can store it behind or under furniture. I bought mine for $14.99 at a Sierra Trading Post store near me. This was their regular price and they only had one left which was a floor sample. It also had a slight scratch in the top but the table so impressed me that I overlooked that and purchased it anyway since it is also cheaper than Amazon. According to Amazon's site it can also be used as a stool for anyone weighing 200 pounds or less. I tried it as a stool and it was reasonably comfortable.<br /><br />In summary, this table may be tiny standing 15 inches tall when open but it is well-designed and versatile for many uses as a side table or stool. It folds down thin and the frame can be used as a carrying handle. It is also light enough to carry anywhere.

2205,3.0,Workhorse of a cart.  Needs improvement.,"Easy folding, easy storage in trunk of a car, to/from golfing. Holds up to daily wear and tear.

Excellent on that account.  My experience with the middle wheel is negative.

She needed a new soccer ball, since her previous ones were worn out and losing air, so I went ahead and got the Wilson NCAA Forte Fybrid II, the official soccer ball of the NCAA championship games.<br /><br />Straight from the box, this soccer ball is a little lighter than expected. In fact, when it arrived in the mail, I thought it had to be something else because the box seemed too light to have a soccer ball inside. But that is what it was and within seconds of opening the box, my kid grabbed it and started to practice.<br /><br />The standout feature with this soccer ball is the design. The colors make it easy to spot and follow with your eyes during play and the textured surface is better for ball control and taking shots. It is superior to other, less expensive soccer balls, some of which have a completely smooth surface and seem more like a volleyball than a soccer ball.<br /><br />My kid reports that this soccer ball is easily better than others she owns so I will take her word for it in that department. However, I am a little concerned about the price. It seems quite costly for a soccer ball and I can see how some people will have reservations about buying for that reason. I can’t really compare this directly with other soccer balls of comparable price because I have never purchased one. But I would bet that, somewhere out there, a manufacturer has a soccer ball that is just as good and priced lower than this one.<br /><br />Soccer is a big deal to my kiddo and she does like the Wilson NCAA Forte Fybrid II soccer ball.

2238,4.0,"Too narrow, otherwise a five star product","I received this as a review sample and was quite honestly surprised by how cleverly it's designed. More about that below. The main issue I have and why I subtracted a star is it's a little on the narrow side. Otherwise, it's perfect. And for me that includes the relative thinness because I tested it outside on my lawn and it was actually comfortable. Or as comfortable as it can be since laying on it is akin to walking a tightrope because of its narrowness.<br /><br />When I claim it's cleverly designed I am not exaggerating. It self inflates by opening a valve. For me between the material and the inflation it was sufficiently thick to be comfortable on my lawn. Obviously it will require relatively level and soft (or at least rock free) ground. I closed the valve after it inflated and when I was ready to roll it up all I had to do was open the valve and tightly roll it.<br /><br />The rolling up part was where I expected a struggle, but that was smooth. It does not roll back up as tightly as it's rolled when you first receive it, but there is still ample room to place it in the included carrying bag.<br /><br />If I have one recommendation for improvement (aside from making it wider) it would be to use velro straps attached to the air pad instead of the elastic 'garters' that come with it.

They have a high waist with about 3/4 inch elastic encased at the top, and the legs are pretty long.  These are a size LARGE<br /><br />SIZING<br />I got a size LARGE because my daughter usually wears between a size 10 and 12 US size misses.  I figured that these would be plenty big enough for her.  I gave them to her to try on and finally she decided to try them on.  I was startled by screams from her bedroom about, ""Hello, camel toes""<br /><br />These were too tight, they did not fit right and the dreaded ""camel toes"" effect in the crotch made them an instant ""NO"" for her.  I usually wear a misses LARGE and these did not fit at all.  They were way too small.<br /><br />SEE THROUGH?<br />These are not quite as see through as other pants of this type, but they are way too tight.

Where I play the water visibility drops off quickly and 9 ft is more than enough.

Overall size is more than adequate for x2 to either picnic or lay sleeping bags on. Ample room to totally engulf x1 adult with ease.. 5* for all size aspects..<br /><br />Surpassing all of the above expectations- I was surprised in amount of fill.. it was less than expected, especially if to bring added cushion and comfort for sleeping upon. I find this has solid quality, craftsmanship and all attention to detail to be sturdy + withstand wear/tear. Just know.. this won’t be a surplus of cushion on lumpy ground- unless it’s doubled over and used by a single person.. this I’d rate 3.5* for amount of fill or, lack of. Having said that- I do understand the reasoning to why it has the amount it does. So to be fair it was more of my own missed expectation.<br /><br />This has merit for giftability use- its one that will be around for a long time.. greater for campers, hikers, outdoor enthusiast, etc..

I have seen more eloquently engineered sets that fit together better.  For example, this one requires the mesh bag to hold them all together and some lock together piece by piece.  Also, the ladle is a little ridiculous and probably unuseable.  The bowls are minimalist, but usable, the natural sponge is a baffling inclusion, but the wooden spatula/spoon actually seems pretty good.  The Pots themselves are better.  The handles are good enough and the pot lid may actually stay in place a little too well.<br /><br />That sounds like a lot of criticism, but for the price, this set is worth it for the two pots and the spoon.  They are made fairly well, but fairly small.  I'm 6'4&#34; with a ravenous appetite outdoors so this will work for me and that is about it.  So this is probably a soloist set.

But the other way I plan to use it, and reason for ordering it is for security of money or credit cards. Nice way to carry something like that when I dont want to be carrying it in a purse. Reminds me of any number of travel items out there that are created for this purpose. So instead of a bra purse or a belt or ankle hidey garment, this little sleeve feels all the more natural and easier to access. I like it.<br /><br />I can see using this for the gym, especially places that have an ID card.

2335,3.0,Have a few of this style pillow,I have a few of these inflatable pillows and these aren't terrible but they're not the best by any means.  It's nice that they come as a pair however they do not stay in place at all for me.  No matter what I try to do they just slide their way out from under me.  On my last camping trip I just gave up on them and went back to my normal pillow which does a better job at staying in place.  Much like other inflatable pillows they do fill up and compress down quite easily.  Once it was filled with air there was no leakage or anything.  If it had a better means of staying in place I would have given it a far better review but I spent more time with my head off of the pillow than I did on the pillow any time I would take it with me.,1,"['pillow', 'terrible', 'best', 'mean', 'nice', 'come', 'pair', 'however', 'stay', 'place', 'matter', 'try', 'slide', 'way', 'last', 'camping', 'trip', 'gave', 'went', 'back', 'normal', 'pillow', 'doe', 'better', 'job', 'place', 'much', 'like', 'pillow', 'fill', 'quite', 'easily', 'filled', 'air', 'anything', 'better', 'mean', 'place', 'given', 'far', 'better', 'review', 'spent', 'time', 'head', 'pillow', 'pillow', 'time', 'take']"

2369,4.0,Not Quite As Tough As Expected But Looks Like It Will Still Work This Summer So Far,"We have company coming this summer.  This involves a few tents, but one of the people needs an inflatable mattress and room for stuff.  This tent is who we got this for.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY<br />Assembly was not difficult in our trial run.  The instructions were pretty easy to follow and it does not take more than a half hour to put up with two people unless you are with someone VERY efficient in putting up tents.<br /><br />WITHOUT FLY<br />Without the fly, this is a very nice tent - bright, airy, and lots of upper mesh to see the sky.  This is perfect on nice days.<br /><br />WITH FLY<br />The days that rain might be expected are the challenge.  The fly is dark blue.  The dark blue makes this tent feel very warm and almost oppressive some days, but it does protect in the rain.  My point is if you are the type who does not want to take the fly off and put it on constantly, this might be a big dark for you to leave on constantly, unless you plan to just sleep inside and don't care.<br /><br />STAKES<br />The stakes that come with this are not big enough to support the weight of wind and other frustrations.  We got spiral stakes to use with this at least on the key points of stress and it works better.<br /><br />STURDY?<br />We are only using this for this summer, so hopefully it will last through several weeks of use.  We have not had any high winds or severe storms yet so I will have to update as to how well this worked for that.<br /><br />STORM PROOFING<br />One thing we learned about tents over long term is that double tarps are a good idea.  We put one down under the tent leaving a perimeter that is not too big around the edge.  Then we put another inside the tent to further protect should there be a deluge.<br /><br />STORAGE<br />I find that having a separate nylon bag for the fly helps a lot when it comes time to put this tent away.

It just doesn't work as advertised. Also, you can't really tilt the mirror downward, if needed.

2376,4.0,Good Yoga Mat for the Price,"If you like to do yoga, you need a good mat. You need something large enough to fit your full body no matter what the pose and you need something that stays firmly in place. A good mat for this purpose and for a fair price is this Primasole Yoga Mat with Carry Case.<br /><br />Measuring six feet by two feet, this yoga mat is designed to handle most anyone. Only those who are extraordinarily tall will not be able to use this mat. The other standout feature is the thickness. It is about one centimeter thick, so it’s comfortable on your body. And with the included carrying case, you can roll it up and take it with you, wherever you go. It’s lightweight and easily portable.<br /><br />Another cool fact about this yoga mat is that it holds itself in place. You don’t need to worry about slippage, and that is a very comforting thing. The bottom of the mat is incredibly good at gripping the floor, so there are no worries that you might find yourself taking a tumble due to the mat sliding on the floor.<br /><br />Primasole makes many good yoga mats and this one is certainly a good one for the price. Yes, there are better ones out there but at this price point, this mat is as good as any and it’s a great addition to your yoga routine.",0,"['like', 'yoga', 'need', 'good', 'mat', 'need', 'something', 'large', 'enough', 'fit', 'full', 'body', 'matter', 'need', 'something', 'stay', 'place', 'good', 'mat', 'purpose', 'fair', 'price', 'yoga', 'mat', 'carry', 'case', 'six', 'foot', 'two', 'foot', 'yoga', 'mat', 'designed', 'handle', 'anyone', 'tall', 'able', 'use', 'mat', 'feature', 'thickness', 'one', 'thick', 'comfortable', 'body', 'included', 'carrying', 'case', 'roll', 'take', 'lightweight', 'easily', 'portable', 'another', 'cool', 'fact', 'yoga', 'mat', 'hold', 'place', 'need', 'worry', 'thing', 'bottom', 'mat', 'good', 'floor', 'worry', 'might', 'find', 'taking', 'due', 'mat', 'floor', 'make', 'many', 'good', 'yoga', 'mat', 'one', 'certainly', 'good', 'one', 'price', 'yes', 'better', 'one', 'price', 'point', 'mat', 'good', 'great', 'addition', 'yoga']"

2380,3.0,FANTASTIC High Quality Board BUT Lousy Cheap Brace (Came Broken On Top Of That),"One thing my family loves is the ability to play lawn games.  Bocce ball is a favorite around here as is badminton and a few other games we manage to get now and then.  When I saw this game, I thought it would be perfect for our family.  It would have been, had it not been broken upon arrival.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS SET LIKE?<br />First of all, this set is HEAVY.  I mean HEAVY.  That means if you have trouble lifting 50 lb bags of grain or similar type things, this might be a bit tough for you.  It is doable, but challenging.<br /><br />There are two score centers.  Each one is folded up and they both come together back to back in a very tough canvas bag.  The board centers are made of composite board( particle board?) and have a formica type top on them so that drops of water will bead up and not soak in.  There is velcro on the pieces to hold them in place when using each different game and also for storage.  The bars at the top for the ladder toss are metal and each one is color coded for scores<br /><br />There are two rope handles one on each board.  The idea is that you put the game boards in the case and the handles come through a hole in the top of the case for carrying.  Carry pieces come in a mesh bag for the sand bags, and a plastic bag (we replaced with zipper close freezer bag) for the ladder toss pieces.<br /><br />PLAYING PIECES<br />The playing pieces are sturdy and well made.  There are three red and three blue heavy plastic balls joined by a tough nylon cord.  You toss and they wrap around the ladder rungs if you score.  There are also 4 blue and 4 red sand bags- not quite 3 inches square.  The idea is that when the cornhole side of the board is up, you throw them in the hole.<br /><br />GAME PLAY<br />The first way that you set up the game, there are two metal braces that you insert in holes in the frame of the ladder.  The composite board (painted black on the back side) is on the grass or floor.<br /><br />When you are ready to change the game, you unhook the ladder, flip it around and then brace it up in the back with a brace made of composite that props up the ladder underneath, thereby elevating the wood look board at an angle so you can throw the bags through the hole.<br /><br />BROKEN<br />It is quite upsetting that a lot of effort went into this game, yet when it comes to the quality of the brace in the back to hold up the cornhole board, is horrible.  It is very thin particle board (composite) and one of them came broken- it looked like it left the factory that way.  We will try to fix it up by summer if it is possible, but such a horribly heavy game is way too difficult to send back in the mail/delivery.  There should have been better quality control.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY WITH ONE BOARD<br />We still played with the one board and the other propped up (although I really hate a new game being broken when you get it) and the gameplay was a lot of fun.  We only played once outside as we got snow and it never left since.  We played it in the basement, but it is more fun outside.  We like to get as far away as we can to make it challenging.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a simple lawn/basement game that will give loads of fun and hopefully stand up to some use if it is in proper shape when you get it, this is a lot of fun.  We really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, despite the good quality work on most of the boards, the important brace is cheap and thin- this should have never been make like that.  It is heavy to lift so make sure you have someone in the family or group who can lift heavy things to transport and set this up.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I took off two stars for the cheap broken brace.  This never should have passed quality control.  If this had been sturdier in the brace, I would have given it five stars.  As it is, only three.",1,"['one', 'thing', 'family', 'love', 'ability', 'play', 'game', 'ball', 'favorite', 'around', 'game', 'get', 'saw', 'game', 'thought', 'perfect', 'family', 'broken', 'upon', 'set', 'like', 'first', 'set', 'heavy', 'mean', 'heavy', 'mean', 'trouble', 'bag', 'similar', 'type', 'thing', 'might', 'bit', 'two', 'center', 'one', 'come', 'together', 'back', 'back', 'bag', 'board', 'center', 'made', 'board', 'board', 'type', 'top', 'drop', 'water', 'velcro', 'piece', 'hold', 'place', 'using', 'different', 'game', 'also', 'storage', 'bar', 'top', 'metal', 'one', 'color', 'two', 'rope', 'handle', 'one', 'board', 'idea', 'put', 'game', 'board', 'case', 'handle', 'come', 'hole', 'top', 'case', 'carrying', 'carry', 'piece', 'come', 'mesh', 'bag', 'sand', 'bag', 'plastic', 'bag', 'zipper', 'close', 'bag', 'piece', 'playing', 'piece', 'playing', 'piece', 'sturdy', 'well', 'made', 'three', 'red', 'three', 'blue', 'heavy', 'plastic', 'ball', 'cord', 'wrap', 'around', 'also', 'blue', 'red', 'sand', 'bag', 'quite', 'inch', 'idea', 'side', 'board', 'throw', 'hole', 'game', 'play', 'first', 'way', 'set', 'game', 'two', 'metal', 'insert', 'hole', 'frame', 'board', 'black', 'back', 'side', 'floor', 'ready', 'change', 'game', 'around', 'back', 'made', 'underneath', 'wood', 'look', 'board', 'throw', 'bag', 'hole', 'broken', 'quite', 'lot', 'effort', 'went', 'game', 'yet', 'come', 'quality', 'back', 'hold', 'board', 'horrible', 'thin', 'board', 'one', 'came', 'broken', 'looked', 'like', 'left', 'way', 'try', 'fix', 'summer', 'possible', 'heavy', 'game', 'way', 'difficult', 'back', 'better', 'quality', 'control', 'one', 'board', 'still', 'one', 'board', 'although', 'really', 'new', 'game', 'broken', 'get', 'lot', 'fun', 'outside', 'got', 'never', 'left', 'since', 'fun', 'outside', 'like', 'get', 'far', 'away', 'make', 'bottom', 'line', 'simple', 'game', 'give', 'fun', 'stand', 'use', 'shape', 'get', 'lot', 'fun', 'really', 'unfortunately', 'despite', 'good', 'quality', 'work', 'board', 'important', 'cheap', 'thin', 'never', 'make', 'like', 'heavy', 'lift', 'make', 'sure', 'someone', 'family', 'group', 'lift', 'heavy', 'thing', 'set', 'rating', 'took', 'two', 'star', 'cheap', 'broken', 'never', 'quality', 'control', 'given', 'five', 'star', 'three']"

This bag is bigger than his old one 22""Hx 10""Dx 14""W. Does not look oversized or ridiculous. All our bats fit into 4 side pockets. There is an upper elastic band that holds the bat handles close to bag. The shoulder straps have extra padding so they are quite comfortable. There is a small felt-lined interior pocket for watch or phone,  a VERY LARGE main compartment that fits his helmet and several gloves and a bottom zippered compartment to hold cleats/shoes. And an exterior pocket to hold his sunflower seeds.  So far, the zippers have worked pretty smooth. They continue to zip around the corners with no catches.

There is a sheet with exercises mapped out on both sides.  The mesh bag has a cord lock on it for easy closure.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />These bands work very well for that I want them for.  They help me with my leg stretches and my gentle hip work. They also do work well with the door stop.  I found for the leg work the heaviest was best due to the retraction power.  For other areas of the body, I go lighter.<br /><br />QUALITY<br />The quality of these is far better than the last bunch I had which were supposed to be heavy duty.  They should last a little while.  I highly suggest that you check them every time you use them for fraying, stitching, and areas of wear.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These bands are a great way for me to do some gentle rehab for my legs.

2428,3.0,Just what I needed!....until I found the whistle,"I have no idea what peoole are talking about a whistle for. I just got this today because I LOVE the bottle but at times unscrewing the lid was inconvenient, though I will probably use the screw on lid more often. Still, I cut the straw, put it on the lid and cautiously took a drink, waiting for a whistle. Nothing. I have been using it like this just to make sure and will fill it with ice and use it again but so far, it’s perfect. I highly recommend it. You do have to cut the straw for the 32 ounce bottle but you get two straws and a straw cleaner. I think it’s a great deal for the money.<br /><br />EDIT<br />Spoke too soon. Found the whistle. The loud whistle.<br />I played around with this for a couple of days. If your ice has melted, it won’t whistle. When I first put it in, I didn’t have much ice. If it’s full of ice, the whistle is loud. I could get short, non whistle drinks, by first blowing into the straw and then drinking but that’s really annoying. I tried not using the straw at all, again full of ice and water as the instructions indicate (first fill with ice and then water) but the whistle was LOUD.<br />So this does work but not as the bottle instructions indicate it should be used. It will only work if there is not much ice in it. This seems counterintuitive to the original intent of the bottle.<br />So, I will use it but it won’t be when the water is at its coldest. I’m wondering if the designers tested this when it was not full of ice because otherwise, I can’t imagine this thing getting to market.",1,"['idea', 'whistle', 'got', 'today', 'love', 'bottle', 'time', 'lid', 'though', 'probably', 'use', 'screw', 'lid', 'often', 'still', 'cut', 'straw', 'put', 'lid', 'took', 'drink', 'whistle', 'nothing', 'using', 'like', 'make', 'sure', 'fill', 'ice', 'use', 'far', 'perfect', 'highly', 'recommend', 'cut', 'straw', 'bottle', 'get', 'two', 'straw', 'straw', 'think', 'great', 'deal', 'money', 'soon', 'found', 'whistle', 'loud', 'whistle', 'around', 'couple', 'day', 'ice', 'won', 'whistle', 'first', 'put', 'didn', 'much', 'ice', 'full', 'ice', 'whistle', 'loud', 'get', 'short', 'non', 'whistle', 'drink', 'first', 'straw', 'drinking', 'really', 'annoying', 'tried', 'using', 'straw', 'full', 'ice', 'water', 'instruction', 'first', 'fill', 'ice', 'water', 'whistle', 'loud', 'doe', 'work', 'bottle', 'instruction', 'used', 'work', 'much', 'ice', 'seems', 'original', 'bottle', 'use', 'won', 'water', 'full', 'ice', 'otherwise', 'thing', 'getting']"

I get it, you step up and down on it--a friend of mine who is a fitness advisor said basically the best thing you can do with a stepper is to see how many reps you can do in three minutes--but I thought there might be a couple of ideas for exercise routines like I got with my exercise bike and resistance bands.",0,"['quite', 'surprised', 'much', 'like', 'easy', 'around', 'low', 'height', 'using', 'version', 'two', 'piece', 'underneath', 'two', 'foot', 'like', 'block', 'little', 'disappointed', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'received', 'one', 'come', 'exercise', 'get', 'step', 'friend', 'mine', 'fitness', 'said', 'basically', 'best', 'thing', 'see', 'many', 'three', 'minute', 'thought', 'might', 'couple', 'idea', 'exercise', 'like', 'got', 'exercise', 'bike', 'resistance', 'band']"

So I'm awkwardly trying to use the spoon with my right hand. The pros are that they are in a nice little case, so you can just pop them into your pocket or purse and take with you. They are also stainless steel and therefore easy to clean. Cons are the aforementioned left-handed folding up and missing a keychain clip.

2484,4.0,Great customer service!,"[[VIDEOID:6ea5a380165be21e1e67e4358fdf511f]] My wife has tried other brands of smart hula hoops, but this one by FYGL *WAS* her absolute favorite.. Unfortunately after using everyday for a week (30 minutes a day), 2 connectors already broke off. 😢<br /><br />The manufacturer was SO nice to reach out due to this issue and advise how to correct the problem. It is a tedious fixing process, however my wife was able to fix the broken links! She just popped the pin and spring back in place. Before using each time, just make sure the pins on each link are pushed in all the way to prevent this problem from happening again.<br /><br />It does have some pros:<br /><br />-It comes packaged nicely in a box, which includes a drawstring travel/storage bag, and you get 16 connectable links with the set. If your waist is a larger size, there is an option to purchase additional links up to a 52"" waist. My wife has a 30.5"" waist and she used 13 of the links, which is recommended with the size chart.<br /><br />-This smart hula hoop is perfect for beginners, as it is easy to get it going, and to keep the momentum going. My wife has tried other brands, where it's a bit difficult to keep them going... But this is a piece of cake, literally!<br /><br />-Also, it's nice as the links are silicone padded in the belly area, which will help prevent bruising. My wife did slightly bruise using the plastic smart hula hoop without the silicone, so this is a luxury!<br /><br />-The links attach/detach easily, as well as hooking the weight onto the track. The description says that it is quiet... However my wife still found it to be very LOUD! So if you plan on doing this while watching TV, or when the kids are sleeping... I would think again, lol.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-The counter on it did not work - - It turned on, however stays at 0. She followed the exact instructions, but couldn't get it to work. But that is not a big deal as you can use a smart watch to time yourself.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a nice product, with great customer service!",0,"['videoid', 'wife', 'tried', 'brand', 'hoop', 'one', 'favorite', 'unfortunately', 'using', 'week', 'minute', 'day', 'already', 'broke', 'manufacturer', 'nice', 'reach', 'due', 'issue', 'correct', 'problem', 'however', 'wife', 'able', 'fix', 'broken', 'pin', 'spring', 'back', 'place', 'using', 'time', 'make', 'sure', 'pin', 'way', 'problem', 'doe', 'pro', 'come', 'nicely', 'box', 'travel', 'storage', 'bag', 'get', 'set', 'waist', 'larger', 'size', 'option', 'purchase', 'additional', 'waist', 'wife', 'waist', 'used', 'recommended', 'size', 'hoop', 'perfect', 'beginner', 'easy', 'get', 'going', 'keep', 'going', 'wife', 'tried', 'brand', 'bit', 'difficult', 'keep', 'going', 'piece', 'literally', 'also', 'nice', 'silicone', 'area', 'help', 'wife', 'slightly', 'using', 'plastic', 'hoop', 'without', 'silicone', 'attach', 'easily', 'well', 'weight', 'onto', 'track', 'description', 'say', 'however', 'wife', 'still', 'found', 'loud', 'plan', 'watching', 'kid', 'sleeping', 'think', 'lol', 'con', 'work', 'turned', 'however', 'stay', 'instruction', 'get', 'work', 'big', 'deal', 'use', 'watch', 'time', 'overall', 'nice', 'product', 'great', 'customer', 'service']"

I contacted Schwin several times to see I they had any other seats available, and no reponse. Dont hold your breath waiting on customer service. I am a bodybuider, so am familiar with hard workouts. The Schwin gives you a great, hard (as hard as you want) workout. Trouble was, the handle bars broke at the junction where the handlebar connects to the bike/fan area. The only way to fix this was to take that area completely apart and insert a new axle. This would have been a major hassle,and possibly required some welding.

My wife has been wanting a newer one anyway. This one came as a bit of a surprise and it is better than I expected.<br /><br />The chair itself is very compact when stored, taking up about half of the space of typical hunting or beach chairs like this. That was a little startling and I was actually a little unsettled when I unboxed it. I realized that the segments came apart but I did not know the chair broke down this compactly.<br /><br />The description says “1-minute set-up”. That’s a little ambitious but I will say it took very little time to set up from the time it came out of the nylon carrier to the time it was completely assembled and ready. It clearly takes more time than most folding chairs of this basic design, and the extra time was in getting the frame completely set up properly. There was a small amount of effort required to get the actual fabric attached but this wasn’t too hard.<br /><br />The chair itself seems very lightweight and I was concerned that it would not support me, but I was pleasantly surprised when I sat in it and it didn’t flinch. It is surprisingly comfortable too, though the lumbar support is minimal.<br /><br />Teardown is quick and easy, and it took me slightly more time to disassemble the chair than to assemble it. I was able to get it back into the bag without too much effort, either.<br /><br />This is a decent folding chair that’s suitable to taking just about anywhere, It’s small enough to fit inside a backpack, it is easy to set up and tear down, and it’s comfortable.",0,"['ordered', 'folding', 'chair', 'one', 'use', 'often', 'finally', 'fall', 'apart', 'wife', 'one', 'anyway', 'one', 'came', 'bit', 'better', 'expected', 'chair', 'compact', 'taking', 'half', 'space', 'typical', 'beach', 'chair', 'like', 'little', 'actually', 'little', 'came', 'apart', 'know', 'chair', 'broke', 'description', 'say', 'minute', 'set', 'little', 'say', 'took', 'little', 'time', 'set', 'time', 'came', 'time', 'completely', 'assembled', 'ready', 'take', 'time', 'folding', 'chair', 'basic', 'design', 'extra', 'time', 'getting', 'frame', 'completely', 'set', 'properly', 'small', 'amount', 'effort', 'get', 'actual', 'fabric', 'attached', 'wasn', 'hard', 'chair', 'seems', 'lightweight', 'support', 'surprised', 'didn', 'comfortable', 'though', 'support', 'quick', 'easy', 'took', 'slightly', 'time', 'chair', 'assemble', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'bag', 'without', 'much', 'effort', 'either', 'decent', 'folding', 'chair', 'taking', 'anywhere', 'small', 'enough', 'fit', 'inside', 'backpack', 'easy', 'set', 'comfortable']"

Inserting the batteries are also easy.<br /><br />What I hate about this is that the units are not packaged appropriately for shipment. These are VERY CHEAP lights that I do not feel will last a long time. Also, the screw top that holds the batteries in the flashlight is difficult to re-seat and line up for closure. It took me several tries before the bottoms screwed on correctly.<br /><br />For the price, these are okay as a disposable light source.

2514,5.0,Add this to your home gym now.,"Update: received my replacement fit deck. It had the same problem as the first fit deck, i.e. just a little bit of force (slap with hand) collapses the leg. Since this is the second time I’ve experienced the problem, I figured I’d give it a try before returning the product and calling it quits.  And I’m so glad I did!  I did a chest/shoulders workout, keeping the weight light just to test the waters on its stability before putting more weight on it (but mindful of the 330lb max load and I weigh 170lb). I did 55lb dumbbell, 50lb incline, 55 decline bench press and I didn’t notice any instability or hear the plastic straining against the weight. Granted, I eased my way onto and off the bench and will keep doing so until I can fully trust the bench. So if you’ve only got modest weights at home, this unit should be just fine.<br /><br />I was surprised with how much more pleasant this bench makes banded resistance work.  The added height from the site created almost constant resistance throughout the range of motion on front and lateral shoulder raises.  A combination of this bench and a good set of resistance bands (I have 150lb of resistance) might be able to replicate a traditional cable pulley station, at least the best we can hope for during Covid. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Old: Make sure you test each leg’s locking mechanism before your first workout!<br /><br />Although the unit is rated for 330lbs, I haven’t found any information that specifies whether it can handle that much weight with the legs fully extended and the bench portion set at the incline position. All of the reviews seem to be posted by folks doing light aerobic/HIIT training, which wasn’t very helpful since I plan to use the bench for weight lifting.  I weigh 165lbs and wanted to make sure the unit could handle my weight, plus that of my dumbbells (80lb each).<br /><br />I decided to test each component of the bench first prior to working out and I’m glad I did.  One of the legs collapsed from the locked position when I applied only minimal pressure.  I know that it’s my unit that’s defective, as opposed to the product generally, because the other leg held up just fine under the same pressure.  Thus I’ll be returning this unit and exchanging it for a unit that hopefully has two working legs.",0,"['update', 'received', 'replacement', 'fit', 'problem', 'first', 'fit', 'little', 'bit', 'hand', 'leg', 'since', 'second', 'time', 'problem', 'give', 'try', 'returning', 'product', 'glad', 'shoulder', 'workout', 'keeping', 'weight', 'light', 'test', 'water', 'putting', 'weight', 'bench', 'press', 'didn', 'notice', 'hear', 'plastic', 'weight', 'way', 'onto', 'bench', 'keep', 'fully', 'trust', 'bench', 'got', 'weight', 'home', 'unit', 'fine', 'surprised', 'much', 'bench', 'make', 'resistance', 'work', 'added', 'height', 'almost', 'resistance', 'range', 'front', 'shoulder', 'bench', 'good', 'set', 'resistance', 'band', 'resistance', 'might', 'able', 'cable', 'least', 'best', 'hope', 'hope', 'help', 'old', 'make', 'sure', 'test', 'leg', 'first', 'workout', 'although', 'unit', 'found', 'information', 'handle', 'much', 'weight', 'leg', 'fully', 'bench', 'set', 'position', 'review', 'seem', 'light', 'training', 'wasn', 'helpful', 'since', 'plan', 'use', 'bench', 'weight', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'unit', 'handle', 'weight', 'plus', 'decided', 'test', 'bench', 'first', 'working', 'glad', 'one', 'leg', 'position', 'pressure', 'know', 'unit', 'product', 'leg', 'held', 'fine', 'pressure', 'returning', 'unit', 'unit', 'two', 'working', 'leg']"

I was born last century, closer to the middle than the end, and I swear I don't recall it ever being this daggum cold in Georgia at Thanksgiving. I remember wearing shorts and sweating MANY Thanksgivings. Most Thanksgivings, actually. The thing about cold weather, for me, is once my feet get cold, only running them under hot water for about 5 minutes warms them back up. I usually only have to deal with that kinda cold a couple of months, January through March, and Im usually just fine dealing with it. Welp, the cold came early and so I wanted thick, comfortable, warm socks. Less polyester and more wool. Something reminiscent of slouchy socks from the mid80s. (GADDDDDD I MISS THICK COTTON SLOUCHY SOCKS 😭). These are what I landed on after half an hour of looking through Amazon and they were like a lightning deal or something. They arrived, I laundered them and there has legit not been a day since that I have not worn these socks. I keep them cycling through my washing machine, so it will be interesting to see how long they last.

In all honesty, it is not very attractive in my opinion, but it was functional as ring - if it had fit.  I would recommend sizing down - but if you get one that is too small, it's really not useful either.  I think it's just hard to size a ring without trying it on.

2590,4.0,Decent Home Rower,"We have been in Crossfit for a while and I have found the rower to be a great workout.  Now our busy lives are keeping us from the gym way too often so when we got a chance to get a reviewer rower we were super stoked.  Assembly was ok, especially when you realize that the bolts are prethreaded and need to be removed from the components to use them.  At first I was surprised that none were in the little bag of bolts I was given.  The basic assembly is actually pretty easy, but take a little deciphering from looking at the illustration and reading the brief instruction text.  With many distractions it took me about 35 minutes.<br /><br />The hardest thing about the assembly was getting the seat to right smoothly.  It has a couple plates that can move up and down and for some reason they are loose and fall onto the top of the rails.  I tightened these away from the rail.  Also, there is a bottom roller that needed to be raised with some bolts on the side that took some tightening to get all the rollers in contact and now it glides very well.<br /><br />As for general use.  I now know how spoiled we are to have such nice rowers at the gym.  This is decent quality, but not on par with the pro gym machines.  The tension at top level is not particularly hard but it does keep the fly wheel from flowing.  The computer is good in general, the battery cover was deformed on the back but just looks bad, it functions fine.  We also have a little issue with the general angle that might just be familiarity, but you sit well above the plane of the handles so it feels like I am pulling up more than usual rather than just back.

When the board is deflated, it fits easily in the trunk or the back seat of a car making it highly convenient to transport.<br /><br />I prefer to use this paddle board from a seated position and I love the padded seat attachment. The seat clips into place with four rings that are mounted on the board and requires minimal adjustment. The seat provides good back support as you float, paddle, or fish.<br /><br />The material of this paddle board is very durable and will not puncture if you hit rocks or sticks. It comes with two fishing rod holders and a variety of other accessories. The storage back is large enough to comfortably hold everything you need, and has shoulder straps which make it easy to transport.<br /><br />This is a wonderful and convenient paddle board that will allow you to get out on the water in style.",0,"['high', 'quality', 'paddle', 'board', 'perfect', 'choice', 'variety', 'water', 'come', 'everything', 'need', 'get', 'started', 'inflate', 'pump', 'work', 'well', 'allows', 'get', 'full', 'pressure', 'minute', 'board', 'fit', 'easily', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'making', 'highly', 'prefer', 'use', 'paddle', 'board', 'position', 'love', 'seat', 'seat', 'clip', 'place', 'four', 'ring', 'board', 'requires', 'adjustment', 'seat', 'provides', 'good', 'back', 'support', 'paddle', 'fish', 'material', 'paddle', 'board', 'durable', 'hit', 'stick', 'come', 'two', 'fishing', 'rod', 'holder', 'variety', 'storage', 'back', 'large', 'enough', 'comfortably', 'hold', 'everything', 'need', 'shoulder', 'strap', 'make', 'easy', 'wonderful', 'paddle', 'board', 'allow', 'get', 'water', 'style']"
2602,5.0,Awesome buy!,I read a TON of reviews on different brands and pulled the trigger on this one. My husband is in the military and deploys frequently. Purchased as a gift for easy travel. Quality is fantastic! The pole extends and retracts smoothly as advertised. The fishing reel is high quality and smooth. Nice padded travel case to keep equipment protected. We own an embarrassing amount of fishing equipment from moving all over the country therefore targeting different species of fish and this fishing pole rates up there with our best rods! Can't wait to see how it performs...

2605,5.0,Nice bag with lots of pockets,"While this bag is on the more expensive side, it's a good one. My first observation was that the bag was bigger than I expected. It has several different pockets ranging from a ""hidden"" accessory pocket along the back of the backpack (for phones, etc.), to the main pocket for your paddles, to a bottle pocket. Not the mention the larger accessory pocket and medium-sized misc. pocket.<br /><br />In the main pocket, I'd guess you could fit 3, maybe 4 paddles. Definitely at least 2 without any issues. Also Inside the main pocket, there is a fence hook, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />In the ""middle"" pocket (in between the larger accessory pocket and the main pocket, there is room for some balls + more (I'm thinking grip tape, lead tape, etc.). The zippers on all the pockets feel like your average zippers and I would assume they'd hold up well over time.<br /><br />While this is definitely on the pricier side of pickleball backpacks, I do find it to be pretty nice. Definitely has enough room for all your stuff and feels like a quality bag. I'm expecting this to hold up for a while.

2606,5.0,Just What She Wanted,My daughter was asking me for one of these hoola hoops recently. She said they're very popular on TikTok. This item comes with a thin waist trimmer/wrap. The hoola hoop comes in pieces and requires some simple assembly. She had to take out 3 or 4 of the pieces to fit her waist. I am a plus size 16/18 and it fit me snuggly with just one piece removed. It works well. My daughter really got into it. I couldn't wait to take it off - it wasn't my thing! I think I felt a little claustrophobic in it. My daughter currently has really long acrylic nails and found that she needed help to take it off. She was unable to push the button to take it off on her own.,0,"['daughter', 'one', 'hoop', 'recently', 'said', 'item', 'come', 'thin', 'waist', 'wrap', 'hoop', 'come', 'piece', 'requires', 'simple', 'assembly', 'take', 'piece', 'fit', 'waist', 'plus', 'size', 'fit', 'one', 'piece', 'work', 'well', 'daughter', 'really', 'got', 'wait', 'take', 'thing', 'think', 'felt', 'little', 'daughter', 'really', 'long', 'found', 'needed', 'help', 'take', 'push', 'button', 'take']"

Easy to assemble, has thorough instructions, clear images.<br /><br />This is the TWIN  set, and, my opinion, is that the space for two seems tight.  And, if you have a larger child, I would see no harm in ONE Child in the Twin Seat.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is heavier than small compact strollers.  It is not something you can pop in and out of the SUV.  It is not a stroller you haul to the grocery store!  But if you take it for a stroll on the ground or sidewalk, the ride is smooth, with great control!<br /><br />FIVE ACTIVITIES, 4 SEASONS, 1 CARRIER<br />This is a multifunction, year-round.

2614,2.0,"Instructions not very comprehensible, folding and unfolding it is taxing.","This is an initial impressions commentary less than it is a review. I plan on following up once I've had at least a month's worth of activity with it. Here in Chicago, the weather has been varying at the time of this review, so we've been able to use this only about a solid week's worth.<br /><br />The night I received it I assembled it immediately. I've put together a few strollers, so I didn't intend on taking longer than twenty minutes. Not with this stroller. It took me almost an hour. The instructions came in two parts: one sheet indicating that it may be difficult to unfold at first, and the main instructions. Indeed, the stroller is very difficult to unfold at first, and it is difficult to fold back.<br />The instructions were not very coherent; the illustrations, instead of being reference models as in most manuals, were black-and-white photographs which made it difficult to discern exactly what they were trying to portray. Half the time I was trying to figure it out, and ended up going with my gut-feeling (which, thankfully to my previous stroller assembly experiences, led me to the correct outcomes).<br /><br />Unfolding it the first time proved very difficult. Again, I did this myself with the assumption that it wouldn't be very difficult, so I did have a harder than usual unfolding it into its locked position. Once everything was assembled (mind you, you will need to provide your own tools as mine came with the wrong sized hex/L wrench and was missing the other tool, whatever it was), I was ready to put it in the basement for the time being. We live in a pretty spacious apartment building with plenty of basement storage, and that's where we store all of our strollers, etc. Folding it back was pretty rough; I could not for the life of me tell where the unlocking mechanisms were due to the poorly lit photographs, so I had to figure it out. Once I got it, however, one side of the locks was very hard to unlock.<br /><br />On our first walks, however, the stroll was fine. It glides pretty smoothly, but I wish the handlebar had an easier and quicker way to adjust the angle, as our previous strollers have. As I mentioned before, it's very difficult to unfold and requires two people, so when my wife tried to get the stroller out on her own she was unable to due to the force required. Who knows how this will be with time.<br /><br />As I've mentioned, I will follow up with a more experienced review.",1,"['less', 'review', 'plan', 'least', 'month', 'worth', 'activity', 'weather', 'time', 'review', 'able', 'use', 'solid', 'week', 'worth', 'night', 'received', 'assembled', 'immediately', 'put', 'together', 'taking', 'longer', 'minute', 'took', 'almost', 'hour', 'instruction', 'came', 'two', 'part', 'one', 'sheet', 'may', 'difficult', 'first', 'main', 'instruction', 'difficult', 'first', 'difficult', 'fold', 'back', 'instruction', 'instead', 'model', 'black', 'white', 'made', 'difficult', 'exactly', 'trying', 'half', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'ended', 'going', 'feeling', 'assembly', 'experience', 'correct', 'first', 'time', 'difficult', 'difficult', 'position', 'everything', 'assembled', 'mind', 'need', 'provide', 'tool', 'mine', 'came', 'wrong', 'sized', 'missing', 'tool', 'whatever', 'ready', 'put', 'time', 'live', 'pretty', 'plenty', 'storage', 'store', 'etc', 'folding', 'back', 'pretty', 'life', 'tell', 'due', 'figure', 'got', 'however', 'one', 'side', 'lock', 'hard', 'first', 'walk', 'however', 'fine', 'pretty', 'smoothly', 'wish', 'handlebar', 'easier', 'way', 'adjust', 'difficult', 'requires', 'two', 'people', 'wife', 'tried', 'get', 'due', 'know', 'time', 'review']"

I was worried the pack just didn't work for me, but I wore it anyway and by the 3rd use the stiffer back panel had loosened up and it's no longer uncomfortable. Definitely would recommend playing around with the straps and ""breaking it in"" to get a comfortable fit. I'm definitely happy with this pack and will often wear this around even when I'm not hiking, if I don't want to bring a water bottle with me.<br /><br />If you do shorter hikes I might say a smaller pack may be better because I wear my pack nearly empty on shorter hikes (besides the water) and sometimes wish I had something a bit more compact, especially when I'm getting really sweaty haha<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!:)",0,"['pack', 'great', 'longer', 'hike', 'long', 'day', 'bladder', 'hold', 'enough', 'space', 'hike', 'couple', 'mile', 'long', 'summer', 'heat', 'plenty', 'pocket', 'carry', 'extra', 'stuff', 'pack', 'feel', 'thin', 'light', 'well', 'first', 'sit', 'flat', 'back', 'kind', 'uncomfortable', 'lower', 'back', 'pack', 'work', 'anyway', 'use', 'back', 'longer', 'uncomfortable', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'playing', 'around', 'strap', 'get', 'comfortable', 'fit', 'definitely', 'happy', 'pack', 'often', 'wear', 'around', 'even', 'hiking', 'want', 'water', 'bottle', 'hike', 'might', 'say', 'smaller', 'pack', 'may', 'better', 'wear', 'pack', 'hike', 'water', 'sometimes', 'wish', 'something', 'bit', 'compact', 'especially', 'getting', 'really', 'hope', 'review', 'helpful']"

It wasn’t difficult to roll back up and place in the bag. There were also no stitching issues either.

2666,3.0,"Great product, with two caveats","This is a brilliant idea. Saves a lot of time--you can do your own wraps quickly and easily.

Do not try to use them for any sort of direct contact or a) you may injure yourself or others, and b) they will be destroyed quickly. Use them as they were intended and you will be quite pleased with the results.<br /><br />2) There should be a sizing chart on here. These are meant to be very snug-fitting. I ordered a size large, and they were huge. I returned them for medium. I have average-size hands, and figured large should do the trick. Nope. These are meant to fit tightly.<br /><br />---<br />UPDATE: The wrist wrap has started coming apart where it was attached to the glove. I had to sew it back together--I used high-quality dental floss, which is indestructible. One of the ends of the ""fingers"" is coming apart. This is due to trying to remove them--they are VERY hard to take off after a workout. They fit snugly (like a second skin), and it takes several minutes to work each hand off without tearing them. Even so, one of the fingers is still coming apart.

It's not spill-proof: the straw is inserted into a hole in the middle of the lid that has a small ""divot"" to allow air into the sealed tumbler so that you can sip.  The straw fits nicely into the hole, but the divot leaves an opening for liquid to escape.  Since I'm not very hard on my water bottles, I don't consider this a problem.  I'm not prone to dropping or tipping them, so there shouldn't be a problem with spillage.<br /><br />The sleeve provides *some* insulation so that my drink does stay colder longer than a non-insulated bottle, but not as long as a vacuum bottle.  I hand-wash mine -- it's just something I do each night before I go to bed -- so I don't need to deal with removing and replacing the sleeve.<br /><br />For the price, I think it's a good deal.

I have a 2006 Toyota Camry Solara Convertible and the box says it will not fit years 1993 to 2008. Nevertheless, I decided to see for myself. Due to the way the bike rack is configured, the top bar almost comes off the trunk.  As a result, there would be room for only one bike as the track adjusts back and forth depending on how tight it has to be cinched (based on the car model, of course). There are two provided clips that go through the holes to keep the track from sliding after the correct length is reached.<br /><br />I then wanted to try this on my boyfriend's car which is a 2010 Honda Accord and it also will not fit that either without a special part. Overall, I am disappointed. I had automatically assumed bike racks were universal and did not realize that was not the case. I also did not realize that there is a chart that can be consulted to check for fit. That was my mistake.<br /><br />Despite this, based on what I have noticed with this rack, the instructions are not very good. Both my boyfriend and I tried to figure them out and found them confusing. In addition, neither one of us believe this would fit three bikes unless the top rod was fastened all the way out and I doubt one would have that option on every car.

My only complaint is they changed the style of the connector chain link so it no longer has a removable locking pin face which you can disconnect to take out a link after the chain stretches from use.  Now there is no way to take out the connector chain link without destroying it and replacing it (as their instructions declare, it can not be reused).  Their old one could be removed and reinstalled without much fuss.  This just means I'll have to old school take out the links with a link tool when I need to shorten my chain, which is a pain.  Feels like they just want you to have to buy a new chain link piece every time from them, which sucks.",0,"['great', 'chain', 'ride', 'fixed', 'gear', 'bike', 'daily', 'chain', 'hold', 'year', 'weather', 'little', 'give', 'complaint', 'style', 'chain', 'longer', 'pin', 'face', 'take', 'chain', 'stretch', 'use', 'way', 'take', 'chain', 'without', 'instruction', 'old', 'one', 'without', 'much', 'mean', 'old', 'school', 'take', 'tool', 'need', 'chain', 'pain', 'feel', 'like', 'want', 'buy', 'new', 'chain', 'piece', 'every', 'time']"

2693,2.0,"Concept is Okay, but Too Many Issues to Recommend","We like to play games in my household and since my kids love electronics, it makes sense that electronic games would be a popular option with them. So, given my kids love of lights and action, we decided to give Franklin Sports Electronic Basketball Bounce Junior a try.<br /><br />The game concept is simple enough. You bounce one of the two small basketballs on the trampoline  aim for the hops, and try to achieve the highest possible score. You have 30 seconds to hit as many hoops as you can, with the bottom nets worth 10 points, the middle worth 30, and the top one worth 50. Once the 30 seconds are up, the electronic scoring display will show you the result. You can then challenge someone else and make real game out of it. It’s simple fun and kids like it, so it does earn some points in this area.<br /><br />Other qualities of this toy, however, convince me to reduce my rating. One is the construction. They need to come up with a better way to explain how the different pieces fit together. I couldn’t get the net to fit at first and it was because I didn’t assemble some of the pieces correctly. A little better, more thorough effort on the part of the manufacturer would have made it much simpler and less frustrating.<br /><br />I have other issues with this toy besides the assembly. One is the ball return. The netting and back piece are loose and are supposed to provide enough space for the balls to drop back to the front so that you can bounce them in quick succession for the best possible score. But the problem is, the balls get stuck, costing valuable time because you have to reach behind and move the backing around to get the ball to drop. This most commonly happens if you hit the 30 or 50 point hoops. The 10 point hoops seem to have sufficient clearance. Another issue I have is with the extension of the net. It needs to be larger so that it can capture the misses and keep the balls contained. But it doesn’t extend very far and that means the basketballs will likely go flying in different directions, again forcing someone to chase them down as the bounce away from the game. Then, there is the trampoline. I don’t know why, but when we bounce, the balls tend to go toward the left. Even a concerted effort to hit the baskets on the right side often doesn’t work- the balls keep wanting to go to the left.<br /><br />I like the overall idea of this basketball game and the price is reasonable. But the manufacturer needs to make a few simple changes to make the game better. At the very least, the backing needs to be larger so that the balls return with ease. With this and other issues, I cannot rate this game very highly or recommend it overall.",1,"['like', 'play', 'game', 'since', 'kid', 'love', 'make', 'game', 'option', 'given', 'kid', 'love', 'light', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'game', 'concept', 'simple', 'enough', 'one', 'two', 'small', 'try', 'possible', 'second', 'hit', 'many', 'hoop', 'bottom', 'net', 'worth', 'point', 'middle', 'worth', 'top', 'one', 'worth', 'second', 'display', 'show', 'result', 'someone', 'else', 'make', 'real', 'game', 'simple', 'fun', 'kid', 'like', 'doe', 'point', 'area', 'quality', 'toy', 'however', 'rating', 'one', 'construction', 'need', 'come', 'better', 'way', 'different', 'piece', 'fit', 'together', 'get', 'net', 'fit', 'first', 'didn', 'assemble', 'piece', 'correctly', 'little', 'better', 'effort', 'part', 'manufacturer', 'made', 'much', 'less', 'issue', 'toy', 'assembly', 'one', 'ball', 'return', 'back', 'piece', 'loose', 'supposed', 'provide', 'enough', 'space', 'ball', 'drop', 'back', 'front', 'quick', 'best', 'possible', 'problem', 'ball', 'get', 'stuck', 'time', 'reach', 'behind', 'move', 'around', 'get', 'ball', 'drop', 'hit', 'point', 'hoop', 'point', 'hoop', 'seem', 'another', 'issue', 'net', 'need', 'larger', 'keep', 'ball', 'doesn', 'far', 'mean', 'likely', 'different', 'direction', 'someone', 'away', 'game', 'know', 'ball', 'left', 'even', 'effort', 'hit', 'basket', 'right', 'side', 'often', 'doesn', 'work', 'ball', 'keep', 'left', 'like', 'overall', 'idea', 'game', 'price', 'manufacturer', 'need', 'make', 'simple', 'change', 'make', 'game', 'better', 'least', 'need', 'larger', 'ball', 'return', 'issue', 'rate', 'game', 'highly', 'recommend', 'overall']"

There is a rubberized Golden State Warriors logo (blue and gold) on the side and end.<br /><br />A nice feature is that the duffel folds easily into a round zippered end pocket, making it compact for storage or travel.  When the bag is unfolded, the zippered pocket becomes a 12” diameter storage pocket.<br /><br />The duffel bag is well made.  The care instructions say “spot clean only”, though I think the fabric will stand up to machine washing.

Eight months ago I started lifting again three times per week and was so overjoyed to see find these collars that I ordered them without fully reading the measurements.<br /><br />My bar is almost one inch and these are for two-inch bars. I am so thoroughly disappointed. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Nevertheless, I had a microphone that was just the right size and I affixed it to that and can tell that these are fantastic. It created a solid grip and did not budge when I pulled on it. Part of the internal collar has what feels like (but is not) a rubberized grip that keeps it in place.<br /><br />To me these are a great invention. My current collars keep loosening as I bench press and plate clamps such as these would ensure that the weights stay on the bar without rattling around and that a quick change of weights is possible. All that has to be done is to loosen the clip, slip the collar onto the bar, and then snap it in place flush with the weight.<br /><br />These plate clamps remind me of another great but simple invention that I consider fantastic in the weightlifting world and that is the [[ASIN:B0017DGBY8 Manta Ray]].

I was hoping that I could take this to school and use it with the kids in PE class, but alas, the flags have spikes at the ends to go into the ground so it can rest on flat, smooth surfaces. We didn't have any issues with the length of the grass interfering with the pieces, but our lawn was freshly mowed when we played it. I could see it being an issue though.

2738,5.0,Shines like a silicon rock,"Even though the picture here for the silver variable is wrong (the real deal does have zoom adjustment ring), this scope is all kinds of right. For the money (and sometimes you can find it even lower) you get a fantastic little rimfire scope with coated lenses and included rings. Set it up on my 10/22 SS and the combo’s wicked fun. The windage and elevation adjustments are great, even though it’s hard to see on the black plastic which way it’s supposed to turn for what – easy fix, use some silver permanent marker to slightly highlight the raised letters and arrows. You don’t need any tools to do the adjustments, and the internal posts are good quality brass. The reticle is a simple 4 plex cross with no BDC holds or any other markings – it’s a point and shoot – for my rifle I set it at 50 yards and it’s spot on (1/2” group was the best I got out of 150 rounds first time with it at the range.) The zoom adjustment wheel is smooth and not too difficult to turn. The included dovetail rings are decent even though there’s no vertical center screw for recoil motion lock – again, this is for rimfire or lighter recoil. I wouldn’t (or I don’t even think it could) mount these on a picatinny rail, but they fit 11mm dovetail no problem. The silver color is a bit too shiny for my taste, that’s maybe my biggest hang-up.

2749,3.0,A low-budget gym that comes with no assembly instructions and one minor defect,"This gym arrives in a small box. It comes in 26 pieces with one tightening key and one written &#34;exercise&#34; sheet but no assembly instructions. I also needed to use a hammer (not included) when assembling the pull-up bar.<br /><br />I am somewhat mechanically inclined, so I was able to use the visual pictures on the box (see last two pictures) to assemble the gym. The screws that attached the arms to the long bar of the pull-up bar caused me a lot of trouble. I eventually had to hammer the screws into the &#34;square&#34; hole when no amount of turning would screw them in. If it were not for that difficulty, I would have had this assembled in about 20 minutes instead of 45 minutes.<br /><br />- The ab wheel is easy to use and rolls nicely on a carpeted floor.<br /><br />- The push-up bars are a bit disappointing because the foam handles keep sliding back and forth when I try to do push-ups. The foam needs to be snug and not loose like it is. It requires certain positioning to keep these foam handles from moving.<br /><br />- The pull-up bar is not something I will use as intended for two reasons. I feel like I will rip my molding off the door frame if I use this or mar my wall surface. Also, I am not (nor was I ever) strong enough to pull up my body weight. Nevertheless, this can be used on the floor as sort of a push-off bar as shown in the last picture.<br /><br />Overall, I am disappointed in this set. The exercise sheet provided is not an exercise sheet at all. There are no assembly instructions, which is a requirement to me. I also do not like that the foam handles on the push up bars slide around and are unstable. If the foam handles stayed in place, I would have rated this four stars. However, because I consider that a defect coupled with the fact that not everyone will find it so easy to assemble without instructions, I am giving this three stars. Nevertheless, this is a low-budget option for those that do not mind the lack of instructions.<br /><br />PHOTOS:<br />Photo one and two are the front and back of the only instructions provided, which is supposed to be an exercise sheet but has nothing to do with exercises. This sheet is a useless piece of paper to me. Photo three includes a picture of the two push up bars and the one ab wheel. Picture four includes the reverse (non-business) side of the pull-up bar and picture five is the business-side (the side where the user positions him or herself) of the bar. The last two pictures are the front and back of the box cover showing the product in use and is what helped me assemble this gym.",1,"['gym', 'small', 'box', 'come', 'piece', 'one', 'key', 'one', 'exercise', 'sheet', 'assembly', 'instruction', 'also', 'needed', 'use', 'included', 'pull', 'bar', 'somewhat', 'able', 'use', 'picture', 'box', 'see', 'last', 'two', 'picture', 'assemble', 'gym', 'screw', 'attached', 'arm', 'long', 'bar', 'pull', 'bar', 'lot', 'trouble', 'screw', 'hole', 'amount', 'screw', 'assembled', 'minute', 'instead', 'minute', 'wheel', 'easy', 'use', 'roll', 'nicely', 'floor', 'push', 'bar', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'foam', 'handle', 'keep', 'back', 'try', 'push', 'foam', 'need', 'snug', 'loose', 'like', 'requires', 'keep', 'foam', 'handle', 'pull', 'bar', 'something', 'use', 'intended', 'two', 'reason', 'feel', 'like', 'door', 'frame', 'use', 'wall', 'surface', 'also', 'ever', 'strong', 'enough', 'pull', 'body', 'weight', 'used', 'floor', 'sort', 'push', 'bar', 'last', 'picture', 'overall', 'disappointed', 'set', 'exercise', 'sheet', 'provided', 'exercise', 'sheet', 'assembly', 'instruction', 'also', 'like', 'foam', 'handle', 'push', 'bar', 'slide', 'around', 'foam', 'handle', 'place', 'four', 'star', 'however', 'consider', 'fact', 'everyone', 'find', 'easy', 'assemble', 'without', 'instruction', 'three', 'star', 'low', 'option', 'mind', 'lack', 'instruction', 'photo', 'photo', 'one', 'two', 'front', 'back', 'instruction', 'provided', 'supposed', 'exercise', 'sheet', 'nothing', 'exercise', 'sheet', 'useless', 'piece', 'photo', 'three', 'picture', 'two', 'push', 'bar', 'one', 'wheel', 'picture', 'four', 'non', 'side', 'pull', 'bar', 'picture', 'five', 'side', 'side', 'user', 'position', 'bar', 'last', 'two', 'picture', 'front', 'back', 'box', 'cover', 'product', 'use', 'assemble', 'gym']"

2766,3.0,The biggest negative is that there's no way to know the tension; also I suspect this would easily break at the highest tension,"I had carpal tunnel surgery on both my left and right hands last year. As a result of the carpal tunnel, I had no strength in my hands. In order to build strength, I purchased some of the same tools the therapist had in her office in addition to other tools that serve the same purpose.<br /><br />Below are the strengtheners I already have. The last two I wasted my money on and wish I never purchased them. The first one is very light and only needed if one doesn't have any strength in their hands like me. If there is some strength, then I recommend the 3, 5, 7, & 9 pounds only.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6JY CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Yellow, X-Light Tension (1.5 lbs per finger]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6GC CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Red, Light Tension (3 lbs per finger)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6KS CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Green, Medium Tension (5 lbs per finger)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6JO CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Blue, Heavy Tension (7 lbs per finger)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HB7V6HG CanDo GripMaster Hand Exerciser, Black, X-Heavy Tension (9 lbs per finger]]<br />[[ASIN:B000UMHUSI PRO Hand and Finger Exerciser, Extra-Heavy Tension (11 lbs per finger)]] - TERRIBLE GRIP, NOT RECOMMENDED<br />[[ASIN:B00KH3L7KC PRO Hand and Finger Exerciser, XX-Heavy Tension (13 lbs per finger)]] - TERRIBLE GRIP, NOT RECOMMENDED<br /><br />Since I own and use the above tools, I wanted to see how this compared. What I like about this hand grip is that there's a counter on the bottom of the handle to count how many reps are completed. Every time the handle is squeezed, the counter increases by one. There's also a tension wheel on the side. When turned down all the way toward the bottom of the handle, that is supposedly 20 pounds. When turned up all the way toward the top of the grip, that is supposedly 80 pounds.<br /><br />This is supposed to be rated between 20-80 pounds pressure but there is no way to tell the tension because it's not marked. Also, when I put it at the maximum pressure and had my boyfriend try it, it seemed like it would break after using it at that level for a while. This is made of cheap plastic and I cannot picture it lasting. The rep counter is reset by pushing in the button on the bottom of the handle and turning the dial continously until 99 reps turns to 00.<br /><br />I do like the feel of this gripper on the lowest tension and it definitely will strength my hands and fingers. However, the handle does push up against the  sensitive scar area in the middle of both of my hands, so that is a negative for me. After having tried this, I would not buy this because the tension is not displayed and the handle pushes up against my scars. The fact that I feel it would break at the highest setting would not deter me from purchasing it because I am almost positive I could never get to that setting. Personally, I feel the other hand exercisers I mentioned above (except for the last two listed), are more suitable for me.<br /><br />PS The box says instructional videos are online demonstrating how to use this. I tried to find the videos to see if there was a way to determine the tension but as of this writing on (April 2, 2017) no videos are posted on their site.",1,"['left', 'right', 'hand', 'last', 'year', 'result', 'strength', 'hand', 'order', 'build', 'strength', 'purchased', 'tool', 'addition', 'tool', 'purpose', 'already', 'last', 'two', 'money', 'wish', 'never', 'purchased', 'first', 'one', 'light', 'needed', 'one', 'doe', 'strength', 'hand', 'like', 'strength', 'recommend', 'pound', 'asin', 'hand', 'exerciser', 'yellow', 'light', 'tension', 'per', 'finger', 'asin', 'hand', 'exerciser', 'red', 'light', 'tension', 'per', 'finger', 'asin', 'hand', 'exerciser', 'green', 'medium', 'tension', 'per', 'finger', 'asin', 'hand', 'exerciser', 'blue', 'heavy', 'tension', 'per', 'finger', 'asin', 'hand', 'exerciser', 'black', 'heavy', 'tension', 'per', 'finger', 'asin', 'pro', 'hand', 'finger', 'exerciser', 'extra', 'heavy', 'tension', 'per', 'finger', 'terrible', 'grip', 'recommended', 'asin', 'pro', 'hand', 'finger', 'exerciser', 'heavy', 'tension', 'per', 'finger', 'terrible', 'grip', 'recommended', 'since', 'use', 'tool', 'wanted', 'see', 'compared', 'like', 'hand', 'grip', 'bottom', 'handle', 'many', 'every', 'time', 'handle', 'one', 'also', 'tension', 'wheel', 'side', 'turned', 'way', 'bottom', 'handle', 'pound', 'turned', 'way', 'top', 'grip', 'pound', 'supposed', 'pound', 'pressure', 'way', 'tell', 'tension', 'also', 'put', 'pressure', 'try', 'seemed', 'like', 'break', 'using', 'level', 'made', 'cheap', 'plastic', 'picture', 'button', 'bottom', 'handle', 'turn', 'like', 'feel', 'tension', 'definitely', 'strength', 'hand', 'finger', 'however', 'handle', 'doe', 'push', 'area', 'middle', 'hand', 'tried', 'buy', 'tension', 'handle', 'push', 'fact', 'feel', 'break', 'setting', 'almost', 'never', 'get', 'setting', 'personally', 'feel', 'hand', 'exerciser', 'except', 'last', 'two', 'box', 'say', 'video', 'online', 'use', 'tried', 'find', 'video', 'see', 'way', 'tension', 'video']"

2783,3.0,Totally Overrated,"Now that I have used this Fitbit for a few weeks I feel like I have an idea about it. I've wanted a Fitbit for years, I've heard nothing but amazing things about it and how great they are. Well, to be honest, I am not seeing the greatness of them now that I actually have one. Maybe it's because this is the newest one, maybe there are still bugs to fix, and maybe it could be my phone that just hates everything about the Fitbit app. Honestly, I don't know but either way, I am so unimpressed with this Fitbit.<br /><br />The pros I have found out is that it was easy to set up and make an account with Fitbit. Everything downloaded, updated, and whatever else perfectly. It was easy to change all the settings and personalize everything the way I wanted it. I love that you can customize the face so that it matches your personality or the types of apps or stuff you want it to show first right on the face. I like that you can control your music and pay for your watch too. Those are great ideas and honestly if I got out more and whatever else I can see where tons of people would totally get so much use out of it.<br /><br />My biggest beef I have with this though is the fact that I wear it constantly and I want to keep up mainly with my steps, how much I move, and my sleeping patterns. It doesn't have any problems keeping up with all of that and so much more. The problem I have with this watch is the fact that it disconnects from the wifi and then becomes difficult to sync to the app, if at all. I've already had to reset to factory settings once to get it to reconnect to the app, which also has its own set of challenges because once the watch goes the app doesn't want to do much either. I can't remove the watch to re-add it in the app and I'm unable to view the wifi connections to change them or re-add them. It's like everything stops and becomes completely unusable. It's a real pain, to say the least.<br /><br />Being completely honest, the watch I replaced with this Fitbit was way better and I never had any issues with it syncing to my phone, the app, or anything else. It did everything that this one does but just not as pretty, which honestly I'd much rather the watch to work and do what I want it to do than to have the cool face and whatever else.<br /><br />I am so unimpressed and honestly bummed about this watch not living up to the hype. I am hoping that everything works out and the bugs are fixed soon if these are bugs, but I've no idea. Right now the watch is acting up again and honestly, I am thinking I am about to have to reset it again. If this happens I am going back to my old one that I know works just fine.

2804,3.0,nice concept but somewhat awkard in practice.,"The Apollo Walker Camping Chairs Folding Portable Beach Chairs are quite durable.  The nylon fabric on this chair is quite thick when compared to the cheaper chairs that I purchased to use at my kids' sports events.  The main chair has a reclining feature and the foot stool/chair is made just as well.<br /><br />The concept for this chair is that you can lean back and put your feet up on the foot stool.  When necessary, the stool can be used as a separate chair.  They do work as intended as you can see from the pictures, what you see is what you get.<br /><br />What you can't tell from the pictures is that because of the thicker nylon and the fact that there are two chairs, this is a fairly heavy product.  The chairs are joined together with a clamping system, which means they aren't as easy to separate as a system that can clip the two together.  Also because of the two chairs, they are awkward to fold together and compress small enough to fit back into the bag easily.<br /><br />So the concept is quite good but when actually using it, you'll find that these chairs do require a little more work and have to deal with the extra weight...  that's on top of all the other stuff you're already carrying when you go to sports events or picnics.",1,"['camping', 'chair', 'folding', 'portable', 'beach', 'chair', 'quite', 'durable', 'fabric', 'chair', 'quite', 'thick', 'compared', 'cheaper', 'chair', 'purchased', 'use', 'kid', 'main', 'chair', 'feature', 'foot', 'chair', 'made', 'well', 'concept', 'chair', 'back', 'put', 'foot', 'foot', 'used', 'chair', 'work', 'intended', 'see', 'picture', 'see', 'get', 'tell', 'picture', 'thicker', 'fact', 'two', 'chair', 'fairly', 'heavy', 'product', 'chair', 'together', 'system', 'mean', 'easy', 'system', 'clip', 'two', 'together', 'also', 'two', 'chair', 'fold', 'together', 'small', 'enough', 'fit', 'back', 'bag', 'easily', 'concept', 'quite', 'good', 'actually', 'using', 'find', 'chair', 'little', 'work', 'deal', 'extra', 'weight', 'top', 'stuff', 'already', 'carrying']"

I thought a cheaper set would work as I am hardly ever here. These are the worst set of poles I have ever seen. I have given poles as gifts and was happy this pair was not one such set or I would have been embarrassed.<br />I had set the poles at home, to my desired length. At the lake, before I could even take a step, one kept collapsing at the bottom. I did not trek of road, due to this. I fixed the poles again and hoped they would stay but the bottom of the pole seems very flimsy. I decided to walk to road around the lake....cautiously, I have had a double knee replacement so I rely on the poles a bit more than I used to. The pole stayed fixed to my adjustment but the shock nechanism broke in one of the handles.<br />I have them and as I'm seldom at my mothers, and do not have the time to mess around with sending them back, I will keep them but I cannot recommend them at all and I am baffled by the high rating.<br />I know walking and trekking poles and these are awful.

Everything is accomplished by your feet.<br />* No speed levels. There is only 1 speed, and it's 7.5 mph.<br />* Cannot fold to stow away.<br />* Cannot use scooter as a traditional manual scooter. Because the buttons are on the base, you will be forced to use the electric feature when both your feet are on the base.<br /><br />THE MAIN PROBLEM:<br />--------------------------<br />* It's advertised for 6 to 12 yrs, but I think it's a little difficult for kids in the lower end of that range. My girl is 6, and this did not work out for her on our first day. It's going to take some time. The throttle system is all in the feet. You have to step on the first button, then you push with your other leg to get the scooter to go a certain speed, then you have to step on the back button to initiate the throttle. That's it... you're off! It's pretty fast, and to brake, you need to release that back button and place the same back foot on the plastic guard above the back wheel. It's a lot for a 6 yr old to consume, especially at a high speed. They will panic. But for bigger kids who can get the hang of it quickly, they might be disappointed at the 7.5 mph limitation. So this scooter is too much for beginners, yet too little for advanced users.<br /><br />THE BETTER OPTION ON AMAZON:<br />------------------------------------------<br />* I would spend a little extra and get the Ninebot E10. That scooter can be folded away, has hand brakes, hand throttle, and 3 speed levels. It's lowest level is 6.2 miles and tops at 10 mph. There is no feet coordination to remember. You just peddle the scooter to a certain speed, just like you have to with this Gotrax, but instead of having to worry about where you place your other foot, the throttle is on the right handle, and you simply press down with your thumb. On the left handle is a brake, not only that, it still has a brake on the guard of the back wheel just like this Gotrax. It is much easier to learn for a 6 yr old, and you can learn it at a slower speed of 6.2 mph. When they do get the hang of it, they can go up to 10 mph, and not limited to 7.5 mph. Lastly, with the Ninebot, you can use it as a manual scooter since all controls are on the handle. It would be your child's choice to use the electric component or not. If they're not ready yet, just don't press down on the throttle with the thumb, and simply use it as a normal scooter. You do not have that choice with this Gotrax since all controls are built on the base. Once both feet are on the base, you have no choice but to use the throttle.

2876,5.0,If you are a nerd when gathering statistics about your health then you will love this watch!,"So far, I love this HRM.  I've used HRMs since the early 90's starting with a Polar.  The Polar and the last Timex I owned had a flexible plastic strap.  I don't have a large chest so the contact area of the chest strap did not make a good contact with my body.  Well that has all changed with this model.  The design of the chest strap has been improved.  The contacts have been incorporated right into the stretchable portion of the strap and the contact to my chest is direct and  immediately provides heart rate information.  The functions on the buttons seems to change with every version of watch I buy (the last one I bought was in 2008, a Timex).  If this is your first HRM then you wont have any 're-learning' to do like me.  I'm not sure of the tap technology yet.  It seems like it might be a good idea, but for me (right now I have it on 'medium' sensitivity) it takes multiple taps.<br />If you're a runner, like me, then seeing your heart rate information while you're running might be challenging. If I want to see my heart rate while running at my fast pace, I usually have to slow down to see the screen effectively.<br /><br />The only real grip I have with all my HRMs up to this date is the waterproof 'o-ring' type seal.  After 4 or 5 years the battery has to be changed and my o-ring has been deformed in that time, so it doesn't quite fit the way it should (to make the watch waterproof).  Enough so that the waterproof watch is no longer water proof.  I lost my polar watch and my last Timex watch due to this issue.  And usually after this long time the watch is discontinued and the o-ring has too.  I will either buy a new o-ring for the watch now, or know that when I replace the battery I can no longer wear the watch in the shower or swimming.<br /><br />You might think, &#34;why did he give it 5 stars&#34;.  I use the information from the watch, mainly, after my run to track my conditioning AFTER my run (I like the 'recovery' option of the watch), and now that I know what to expect when changing the battery, I know what I can't do.  I think the benefits of this watch far out-weigh the issues that I've outlined above.  Tracking my heart rate over time is just another statistic for judging my overall health.",0,"['far', 'love', 'used', 'since', 'last', 'plastic', 'strap', 'large', 'contact', 'area', 'strap', 'make', 'good', 'contact', 'body', 'well', 'model', 'design', 'strap', 'contact', 'right', 'strap', 'contact', 'immediately', 'provides', 'heart', 'rate', 'information', 'function', 'button', 'seems', 'change', 'every', 'version', 'watch', 'buy', 'last', 'one', 'bought', 'first', 'like', 'sure', 'yet', 'seems', 'like', 'might', 'good', 'idea', 'right', 'take', 'multiple', 'like', 'heart', 'rate', 'information', 'running', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'heart', 'rate', 'running', 'fast', 'usually', 'see', 'screen', 'real', 'grip', 'waterproof', 'ring', 'type', 'seal', 'year', 'battery', 'ring', 'time', 'doe', 'quite', 'fit', 'way', 'make', 'watch', 'waterproof', 'enough', 'waterproof', 'watch', 'longer', 'water', 'proof', 'lost', 'watch', 'last', 'watch', 'due', 'issue', 'usually', 'long', 'time', 'watch', 'ring', 'either', 'buy', 'new', 'ring', 'watch', 'know', 'replace', 'battery', 'longer', 'wear', 'watch', 'swimming', 'might', 'think', 'give', 'star', 'use', 'information', 'watch', 'run', 'track', 'run', 'like', 'option', 'watch', 'know', 'expect', 'battery', 'know', 'think', 'watch', 'far', 'issue', 'heart', 'rate', 'time', 'another', 'overall']"

2883,5.0,"Great kayak, cheaper elsewhere","I bought this kayak a year ago, and have used it close to 30 times. I have used it as a tandem kayak and as a fishing kayak (not simultaneously - that would be a tight squeeze). It has survived rocky rivers with low water, dozens of fishing trips, and being dragged up boat ramps. I am really impressed with the durability. Also, it fits in the trunk of my Toyota Corolla. Awesome! My only complaint is that the inflatable seats aren't very comfortable for long outings. Also, Amazon is WAY overpriced for this product. When I bought mine, I found it elsewhere for 30% less (still new!). I definitely recommend looking around online before buying here. A good price is closer to $200.<br /><br />Year 2 update:<br /><br />The inflatable seats were the first thing to go. Both seats only hold air for a few hours now. They are made out of a much cheaper material than the rest of the kayak, so I guess that was to be expected. I also got my first puncture on one of the pontoons. I used the patching kit and recommended adhesive, but the patch keeps coming off. I think it is because it falls along a natural crease when the kayak is deflated. That constant bending puts a lot of stress on the patch. It's annoying to keep re-patching it, but it does at least hold air while the patch is on.",0,"['bought', 'kayak', 'year', 'ago', 'used', 'close', 'time', 'used', 'kayak', 'fishing', 'kayak', 'tight', 'low', 'water', 'fishing', 'trip', 'really', 'impressed', 'durability', 'also', 'fit', 'awesome', 'complaint', 'seat', 'comfortable', 'long', 'also', 'amazon', 'way', 'product', 'bought', 'mine', 'found', 'less', 'still', 'new', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'looking', 'around', 'online', 'buying', 'good', 'price', 'year', 'update', 'seat', 'first', 'thing', 'seat', 'hold', 'air', 'hour', 'made', 'much', 'cheaper', 'material', 'rest', 'kayak', 'guess', 'expected', 'also', 'got', 'first', 'one', 'used', 'kit', 'recommended', 'keep', 'coming', 'think', 'fall', 'along', 'kayak', 'put', 'lot', 'annoying', 'keep', 'doe', 'least', 'hold', 'air']"
2884,3.0,Lacking Safety Features,"The bag is nicely padded and there's a semi stiff divider between the section for your weapons and the place to store magazines and ammunition. My chief complaint is there are no straps, which could have easily and cheaply been added, to hold the pistols in the pockets designated for them. If the bag is turned upside down for any reason the pistols can easily come out of the pocket they're stowed in and if you're carrying two as the bag is designed for, they can then bang into one another potentially causing damage to one or both. The divider will keep them from striking the magazines but not from hitting each other. The magazine pouches are, at least now while new, quite tight and hold my 10 and 12 round Sig Sauer P365 magazines tightly in place. Even vigorous shaking didn't dislodge them. The outside pocket had a good size gusset and expands to hold a box of 100 9mm rounds and my Uplula loader with room to spare. It also has a large velcro area for membership patches, flags, etc. The carry handles are comfortable. I wish there was a more secure way to hold your pistols in place and I plan on trying to modify the bag myself to achieve this.

2886,4.0,"Overheating issues, low resistance, but otherwise good.","Excellent price point for what it is. There are no instructions but the diagram was easy enough to figure out.<br /><br />The main problem is the piston overheats with prolonged use and as it heats up, resistance lessens. This means you cannot do an intense 30 minute workout in one sitting, you have to do sets, rest in between, and then do more sets. I'm in no rush, so I can do this, but you should be aware if you buy this.<br /><br />Also, the highest level of resistance doesn't feel like rowing through actual water. It's not particularly challenging. You feel it once you are many reps in, so it still works if you go by volume of strokes. But, again, see above for the overheating issue.<br /><br />Still, if you break the workout into sets of 10 minutes and have maybe 5 minutes of rest time in between, getting 30 minutes of rowing time and 15 minutes of rest still works for me.

It is easy to grip & features a slim profile and rubberized, recessed strip. It drinks easy with no splashing or spilling.<br />I have been driving around with coffee cups for decades but I am new to these double-walled thermal cups. This cup fits a regular cupholder profile so it is tall to hold 16oz. It barely looks full with 12oz of coffee which is the maximum that my single-serve maker will brew. The top also has a large space between the cap & the brim which keeps it from splashing but makes it even taller.<br />It is so tall that I have to put a spacer under my coffee maker to drip into it.

2912,5.0,AWESOME,"I've seen these ""sit and stand"" scooters before, but never really understood them until I had a kid the right age for it. When the seat is folded up, it acts like a regular traditional kick scooter. It has 3 wheels so the child doesn't need to balance it, and tilt side to side allows steering, which works well. The wheels also have little LEDs that seem to be powered by spinning motion- the faster the wheels spin, the more light comes from the wheels. Very cute! But the really cool part, is if/when your kid gets tired, you can fold the seat down and they can coast on a chair. I've gone on many walks with our old scooter and my 3 year old son sometimes gets tired and makes someone hold him... which then means, hold him AND the scooter, and drag it back home. But with this, he can just sit on the scooter. Someone can pull the scooter if necessary, and it is much easier than before.

I was already annoyed at this point since it was a gift for my husband and I couldn't wait for him to see it. As heavy as it is te lid is really flimsy and I think needs heavy hinges and better latch. That's not all though... and took it camping right away 2 days later. My husband turned it on and the popping sound started and he opened it and black flakes flying everywhere. Stupid me didnt pack a campfire grill grate just in case and we ended up having to cover the grates in aluminium foil for our steaks and brats and use the camper microwave and futch oven for everything else! What a pain. We were super dissapointed. Should have got the original. 3 of our camping friends have te original and love it.

2941,5.0,kids camp bunk beds,"UPDATE BELOW:  We purchased these for our grandsons visit (5 and 8) - they are terrific.  Fairly easy to put together - no tools necessary as they snap together with pop in nibs - would be easier with two people - but I managed to put them together by myself (I'm 58 and not super athletic). Once together, they feel very sturdy.  They are the perfect size for our little guys and will be for several years.  They have wonderful cloth bags with zippers and elastic bands to secure the pipes and pieces securely.  The bags have heavy duty handles.  They are fairly heavy - but the bags and handles make it easier to lift and move them.  We chose the turquoise - very nice and true turquoise.  The side organizers are just wonderful and I think the boys are going to love those too - they will hold the tablets, books, a small night light and other things nicely.  I honestly think these are one of our best investments in a while.  Having said all of that.. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.<br />UPDATE:  7/3/2019....  I continue to LOVE these bunks.  I just disassembled the bunk setup - for the first time.  I had taken a picture of the pieces in the cases to help me.  Took me less than 20 minutes!  By myself.  It was so easy.  And the zippered canvas case/bags are the bomb.  So So So easy to store.  I am super impressed.  The boys, 5 and 8, loved them.

2969,1.0,U kidding,"Mounted on a Ruger 10/22 takedown SS, started at 25 and worked progressively all the way back to 75 yards. Love the different types of reticles, for close work, the round one is my fav as it fits perfectly around the 25 yards target. For medium range I go with the cross hairs, and at 75 it's the dot. I've got a cow bell that got rung at 75 yards as many times as it got shot at - if that's not accurate for a red dot, I don't know what is. I was considering dripping a drop of epoxy on each corner (something I do with most of my $50 under reflex sights, but for this one I decided to leave it alone. After couple of times at the range, the glass gasket is still firmly in place - maybe I got a winner. I also like that they put a bit of thought in the design, as yes, it is silver, but the back housing (where the laser is) has a black top which minimizes glare - smart. So if someone had said - $20 and you got your self a keeper, I'd've said, ur kidding!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Ooooooops... second outing. Didn't hold zero. Zero at holding zero (sorry, I had to). All of a sudden, I'm getting this jumps, vertically, horizontally. Try to adjust, then boom - it switches up 5 inches high at 50, boom you're now 3 inches to the left. Kept jumping all over the place. Right there and then, I put a zero on its life - it's at the bottom of a trash can. Look, if you LOVE wasting time and money, GET THIS!

I have noticed while knitting lately that I could use some exercise to keep my hands and wrists from getting sore, so I thought I would try these out.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These two balls that come in this kit are two different types.  One is very soft and the other is a little harder to press.  The lime one is the softer one that you begin with.  This comes with a sheet that has photos and descriptions of different exercises to do.  I have to say that the cautions of catching breath and heart problems made me chuckle.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE WORK?<br />I have been using the softer version at first doing the exercises daily and did notice after a week that my hands were not hurting as much when I was knitting.  I just changed to the stiffer one and it is more challenging, but it feels nice on the hands, forearms and wrists.<br /><br />VIDEOS?<br />I did not find any videos on these, but if I do, I will update.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For strengthening hands, fingers, and forearms, this is a great simple kit.  Exercises are easy to follow with photos and descriptions.  I did notice some relief after just a week.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />This is a nice kit.

They keep the water out but still feel a little odd at first.  Noise cancelling is a no go.  It will somewhat but when you say noise cancelling this isnt what you would expect. They have to be pushed deep and hard Into ears for them to start having a good enough cancellation effect.  I found them to be a pain to remove as well especially if u push them deep to make sure they fit ur ear and keep out water.  With wet fingers wet plugs they can be a pain to remove.  This may not be the case if your fingers are dry.  Over all it was a six pack of plugs and nose clamps for the same price as 2 pair of plugs that look exactly the same from a different store.

3004,3.0,Knife-like edge is USELESS but spoon & fork are great,"This is a very light SPORK and feels like it is made out of piece of tin.

There is a spoon on the other end. The center holes can be used to fasten this to a backpack.<br /><br />I got this because many times when I go on a staycation, I pack a cooler with yogurt and stuff for day travel.

3010,5.0,Perfect for personal hygiene and some cleaning,"The review sample I received is perfect for campers who want the convenience of portable personal hygiene and light cleaning tasks.  The flow rate of this shower is 2.5 cubic inches per second, which manages to conserve water while providing sufficient pressure for wet-lather-rinse showers. To be sure this is not a high pressure pump and shower head, but is effective.<br /><br />It also works for light duty utensil rinsing and other similar tasks. You can even shampoo pets outside without using risky 110/120 volt power. The instructions are both clear and contain a lot of useful information. I recommend taking the time to read them over before using this shower head for the first time. There are a few gotchas that you need to heed, including not exceeding USB charging sources of 1.2 Amps.<br /><br />Assembly is simple, but you need to make sure you do not lose the hose O-ring (I store mine in a plastic envelope). Also you need to ensure that the filter is routinely cleaned, especially if you are camping and using treated spring, lake or river water. This works perfectly with the [[ASIN:B0009PUQVY Coleman PVC Double Wash Basin]] or similar basins. Make sure that whichever basin you use is sufficiently deep to completely submerge the pump. I recommend a minimum of four inches to be on the safe side.<br /><br />While the USB charging feature is a big plus, you can also use this with an [[ASIN:B00E3OL5U8 Anker 14W Solar Panel Foldable Dual-port Solar Charger]], which is perfect for camping.  You can get about an hour of use for every two to five hour charge.

3011,4.0,Love this chair!,"This is our second chair of this style, and I honestly really like them both very much. The first time I tried one of these, I was concerned because it doesn't FOLD and UNFOLD quickly like my old camping chairs, you have to assemble it. I called this a con of the product, but now that I've used it for a bit, I understand the process- in order to break it down into something remarkably small, it has to assemble/disassemble. Putting this chair up is more like a small tent than a folding chair. In fact, the supports feels very similar to the kind you see in tents, with elastic-style cords that keep the parts attached, and actually almost assemble themselves when taken out of the bag. Once all the beams are positioned properly, it's just a matter of putting the seat cover in place using the 4 corner grommets. The advantage is that this chair can easily fit into a backpack or other small carrying space.<br />It is a camping chair at the end of the day so it is a little lower than a regular chair. However, it is great for additional seating when watching movies on our home theater or for backyard movie night with the projector.

3014,3.0,Incredible fun; made of cheap plastic; assembly difficult; scoring incorrect,"[[VIDEOID:92883454e041f127c0f7a42a11a0470a]] This game is highly entertaining and lots of fun to play. Although it is called Whirl Ball, it is exactly like the Skeet Ball played in the Arcades down the shore but on a mobile and smaller scale. Despite its entertainment value, there are some flaws with this game. Nevertheless, I rated this 3 stars ONLY BECAUSE of how much fun this is. However, if you want an accurate and quality game, look elsewhere.<br /><br />FLAWS<br /><br />- First,  assembly is not ""tool-free"" as the box claims. It is difficult to assemble and a screwdriver is required to install the three AAA batteries (NOT INCLUDED) for the scoring mechanism. It comes in five pieces excluding the arrow stickers that have to be placed on the ramp.  There is a ball return shoot that connects to the ramp (2 pieces), left and right ends for the score zone area (2 pieces), and the electronic scoring mechanism (1 piece). I had incredible difficulty trying to seat the left and right end for the score zone area. The instructions are not very good and there are arms (see second photo) that have to be turned to the side so that they are flush with the end. If that is not done, they are in the way. Also, it feels as if the plastic is going to break when assembling this. It took me about 25 minutes to assemble these five pieces mostly because of those left and right ends.<br /><br />- Second, the instructions are practically useless and there really is not any good information on how to play the game itself.<br /><br />- Third, the plastic feels extremely cheap. At the current price of $49.99, I expected much better.<br /><br />- Fourth, I ripped a sticker when removing it from the page it came on. They really should already have the stickers affixed to the ramp before shipment so that they are straight and there is no chance of it being torn during assembly. The stickers for the scoring area are already in place so there is no reason these cannot be affixed at the factory.<br /><br />- Fifth, the electronic scoring unit misses scores. When the play is started, a cheer similar to what happens at a ballgame is played. If my boyfriend or I immediately rolled the ball and made a score, the score would not be counted. Instead we had to wait until the cheer was almost done before playing, so .5 seconds is lost on the clock for the 30-second play. Also, it does not count the score if two balls make a score one right after the other.  You will notice :30 into my video that it counted one 20 pointer and then missed the second one after that. Therefore, when the score said 70, it should have gone up to 90. This means, one has to slow down their play to ensure that all scores are counted. What I noticed is that when it plays back the score count, it will not count the next ball that is sunk during that verbal playback.<br /><br />- Sixth, the ramp is not really smooth as there is a bump at the connection that causes the ball to ""trip up"" sometimes.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Automatic Ball Return Shoot<br />- Built-In Electronic Scoring<br />- Folding Legs<br />- Multiple Score Zones<br />- 2 Whirl Balls<br />- Authentic Arcade Feel<br /><br />In summary, my boyfriend and I love the game. It is lots of fun and provides a truly 5-star experience. However, quality and accuracy are lacking for such a high price point of $49.99.",1,"['videoid', 'game', 'highly', 'lot', 'fun', 'play', 'although', 'ball', 'exactly', 'like', 'ball', 'smaller', 'despite', 'value', 'flaw', 'game', 'star', 'much', 'fun', 'however', 'want', 'accurate', 'quality', 'game', 'look', 'flaw', 'first', 'assembly', 'tool', 'free', 'box', 'difficult', 'assemble', 'install', 'three', 'battery', 'included', 'come', 'five', 'piece', 'ball', 'return', 'piece', 'left', 'right', 'end', 'area', 'piece', 'piece', 'trying', 'seat', 'left', 'right', 'end', 'area', 'instruction', 'good', 'arm', 'see', 'second', 'photo', 'turned', 'side', 'end', 'done', 'way', 'also', 'feel', 'plastic', 'going', 'break', 'took', 'minute', 'assemble', 'five', 'piece', 'mostly', 'left', 'right', 'end', 'second', 'instruction', 'useless', 'really', 'good', 'information', 'play', 'game', 'plastic', 'feel', 'extremely', 'cheap', 'current', 'price', 'expected', 'much', 'better', 'came', 'really', 'already', 'straight', 'chance', 'assembly', 'area', 'already', 'place', 'reason', 'unit', 'play', 'started', 'similar', 'immediately', 'ball', 'made', 'instead', 'wait', 'almost', 'done', 'playing', 'second', 'lost', 'second', 'play', 'also', 'doe', 'two', 'ball', 'make', 'one', 'right', 'notice', 'video', 'one', 'second', 'one', 'said', 'mean', 'one', 'play', 'noticed', 'play', 'back', 'next', 'ball', 'really', 'smooth', 'cause', 'ball', 'trip', 'sometimes', 'feature', 'ball', 'return', 'built', 'folding', 'leg', 'multiple', 'ball', 'feel', 'love', 'game', 'lot', 'fun', 'provides', 'star', 'experience', 'however', 'quality', 'high', 'price', 'point']"

Since it is a 2 pack, I can leave one on my desk and keep one in the car or by my bed.

This is it!!<br />Best of all.. sold at a price point of $30- Are you kidding me!!? Reminiscent of what one would find in a college bookstore..This is a soft, slightly worn in (by appearance only) hoodie that has a timeless and classic look about it. This would stir up memories and make a great gift for any alumni without a doubt.. ha! I actually chose a school that I did not attend- just bc, I loved the hoodie so much!! Plus, I think It’s fair to say the California collegiate system is commercialized in such a way.. making it socially acceptable to wear a name that isn’t affiliated to your education per sé.<br /><br />For those who don’t know… **These are women’s sizes!! NOTHING unisex about this- IF, wanting men’s/universal sizing- this brand does offer this same item in male standard fit. This is cut and sized for the female figure and in doing so, it eliminates a lot of excess bulk- creating a far more flattering look. Having to order XL to insure a fit thru the bust line.. the chest/mid section fit but, without any room to spare! (Feels more in line with Jr. Miss vs. women’s size?!) The length fits a bit longer due to my height and waistband hits just past the bum cheek.

This can easily be layered up and worn in the colder months or, paired with shorts + flip flops over sunburn shoulders for a summer night.. it’s truly the perfect in-between all season item!<br /><br />I do recommend washing on cold and line drying.. just to be certain shrinkage won’t alter the fit! (Especially in my situation- where I have no room to spare!) Loving this so much, I’ve worn frequently the past few weeks.. and fingers crossed, I have not had issue with pilling. **double knot hoodie string- or clip together prior to wash- these are prone to disappear into the hoodie in the wash.. trust me, after 2nd time- I got smart!<br /><br />Hands-down I’d recommend on every level..  this is a great quality, 100% cotton, total classic hoodie that would be appreciated by any- I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",0,"['love', 'trying', 'know', 'one', 'made', 'best', 'price', 'point', 'one', 'find', 'soft', 'slightly', 'worn', 'look', 'make', 'great', 'gift', 'without', 'actually', 'chose', 'school', 'loved', 'much', 'plus', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'system', 'way', 'making', 'wear', 'name', 'isn', 'per', 'know', 'woman', 'size', 'nothing', 'sizing', 'brand', 'doe', 'offer', 'item', 'standard', 'fit', 'cut', 'sized', 'figure', 'lot', 'far', 'look', 'order', 'fit', 'line', 'section', 'fit', 'without', 'room', 'feel', 'line', 'woman', 'size', 'length', 'fit', 'bit', 'longer', 'due', 'height', 'hit', 'past', 'old', 'carry', 'trouble', 'spot', 'waist', 'section', 'kid', 'give', 'solid', 'info', 'soft', 'quality', 'weight', 'nice', 'seam', 'stitching', 'point', 'loose', 'thread', 'easily', 'worn', 'month', 'short', 'shoulder', 'summer', 'night', 'perfect', 'season', 'item', 'recommend', 'washing', 'cold', 'line', 'won', 'fit', 'especially', 'room', 'much', 'worn', 'past', 'week', 'finger', 'issue', 'double', 'string', 'clip', 'together', 'wash', 'wash', 'trust', 'time', 'got', 'hand', 'recommend', 'every', 'level', 'great', 'quality', 'total', 'hope', 'info', 'help', 'decision', 'feel', 'free', 'let', 'know']"

Bracing the device against a wall to hold it in front of my chair didn’t work, because it just shifted sideways.<br /><br />+++The motor is extremely weak (110 V), and just moves the pedals around and around at slightly different speeds, in forward or reverse directions.  The pedals move your feet and legs up and down, but you don’t really get any meaningful exercise, because you aren’t causing the pedals to move.  There Is no way to adjust resistance to make it easier or harder to pedal.  The device offers no feedback on your own expended effort.<br /><br />I purchased the device for my disabled husband to use to build endurance, and it’s a complete disaster.  He can’t keep his feet on the pedals, and he can’t sustain even a brief period of sustained “pedaling”, because the device immediately moves forward away from his chair.",1,"['fitness', 'exercise', 'bike', 'pedal', 'exerciser', 'totally', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'two', 'good', 'feature', 'first', 'easy', 'assemble', 'already', 'know', 'use', 'simple', 'tool', 'read', 'part', 'come', 'child', 'similar', 'assembly', 'item', 'part', 'attach', 'two', 'base', 'pedal', 'second', 'power', 'speed', 'mode', 'button', 'actually', 'hold', 'hand', 'use', 'exerciser', 'two', 'thing', 'bad', 'even', 'fit', 'person', 'hard', 'insert', 'foot', 'pedal', 'strap', 'velcro', 'adjustable', 'strap', 'keeping', 'foot', 'pedal', 'exercise', 'strap', 'short', 'around', 'husband', 'size', 'shoe', 'exerciser', 'away', 'chair', 'even', 'complete', 'minute', 'true', 'rubber', 'mat', 'included', 'device', 'wall', 'hold', 'front', 'chair', 'didn', 'work', 'extremely', 'move', 'pedal', 'around', 'around', 'slightly', 'different', 'speed', 'forward', 'direction', 'pedal', 'move', 'foot', 'leg', 'really', 'get', 'exercise', 'pedal', 'move', 'way', 'adjust', 'resistance', 'make', 'easier', 'pedal', 'device', 'offer', 'effort', 'purchased', 'device', 'husband', 'use', 'build', 'complete', 'keep', 'foot', 'pedal', 'even', 'device', 'immediately', 'move', 'forward', 'away', 'chair']"

3039,5.0,Compact & Powerful,This lantern isn't just for camping. It's great to keep around for emergencies. It's super bright and can light up your surroundings for several feet. One charge can last for up to 100 hours. This isn't your Daddy's lantern. It's a high tech version of the Coleman classic you know and trust. The best part is that it's very light and portable.

For me this tracks pretty accurately with on-bike power meters up to about 300 watts, which for me is barely into sweet spot - beyond that it is progressively less accurate.<br /><br />I know others have made it work with current production Road Machines, so my best guess is that you must have a current Road Machine to get accurate numbers.<br /><br />BTW I tried every recommendation from Kurt to get it to work. Same result with TrainerRoad's built-in spindown calibration<br /><br />In the end I gave up and just put a legit power meter on every bike i ride.

3051,5.0,The Real Deal,"I purchased this pad last week based solely on the positive reviews. If you've spent any time looking at camping equipment on Amazon, you know that many products and their reviews are suspicious. Not here -- this one is the real deal! I just returned from a backpacking trip where it performed so well that I had to immediately write this review even though I just got home, I'm sore, and I'm exhausted.<br /><br />First, the size: A third of the size of the lightest pad from the most well-known manufacturer, (and this one is full body, not just torso like their ultra lightweight). Long enough for me 5'9&#34; and my pillow with room to spare.<br /><br />The quality: Perfectly made, no trouble with the valve or any parts of the pad, no strong odor right out of the package. The material feels so lightweight that I was nervous about popping it but I used it in a tent and directly on a beach for sunbathing and had no issues. I also took a nap on it directly on the hardwood floor in my home to test it for leaks and was very comfortable.<br /><br />The support: I have tried any number of pads for car camping and backpacking over the years and this was by far the most supportive and comfortable for me. Because of the number of chambers, you will bottom out on this one if you don't have all of your weight on it like if you're sitting upright on it or kneeling on it in your tent or whatever. But, if you're resting flat on the pad it is wonderfully supportive. I'm not a small person and I had no issues with getting a comfortable rest on this pad in any direction - back, side, or belly sleeping.<br /><br />The functionality: It is very easy to inflate, took me exactly 12 breaths each time. It's easy to close the valve without air escaping. It's wasn't unreasonably loud against my tent or sleeping bag. The texture of the material was good for holding my pillow in place and I didn't slide off it in my taffeta sleeping bag. It was very easy to roll it up and get it back in it's carrying sack. It never went back in as compactly as it arrived but it was close enough (see photos).<br /><br />I'm thrilled with this purchase and I'm looking forward to many more backpacking excursions with this trusty pad.

I have had a fight with my youngest son about who gets it because he thinks it looks cool. Love the color and logo... I can't say anything but good things about it visually.  The top is actually a stopper which is a little unusual, and I would trust it to hold water if you were to knock it over on a table top, but I don't have much faith in it being leak proof in a backpack. It takes a little effort to pop it out, but I would think that it could easily be worked off.  So that limits it's use a bit, but still perfect for office desk, car, or to have handy on a table when working outside.

3095,3.0,"Thin, super soft beach cloth that repels sand; definitely not absorbent; carrier useless","This beach ""towel"" comes rolled up in a carry case that is a little larger than a water bottle holder. This is made in China of 90% polyester and10% polyamide. It should not be washed in water above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and should never be put in the dryer, ironed, dry cleaned, or bleached.<br /><br />The material does not feel like the microfiber dusty clothes I have come to know which is fuzzy and catches a lot of lint. Instead, this towel is super soft and slinky and thin. It is also large as can be seen when I laid it across the foot of my king-sized bed. The material repels sand, which is great. However, this is not super absorbent in my opinion. I do not like drying myself with this at all. It does absorb water some but it does not feel right against the skin as a beach towel. I felt like I was drying myself with a slinky scarf.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I love the design and functionality of this towel. Unfortunately, once the towel is removed from its carrier, the carrier becomes useless. I tried to put the towel back into its carrier after it was dry and it was impossible. Eventually, the carrier just ripped (see photo).<br /><br />In summary, I consider this more of a thin beach cloth or mat than a towel. I love that it repels sand, feels great against the skin, is lightweight, and large. I love the idea of a carry case but the case is way too small that it becomes useless. I do love the elastic on the towel which allows me to keep it tightly rolled. However, I would never use this like a beach towel to dry myself off. It can, however, be used a little like a wrap on the lower half of the body or slightly over the shoulders. The current price of $20.89 ($21.99 minus 5%) is a little pricey for this.

I go through a lot of various veggies, and now adays items are low in availability (I'm not driving all over for groceries), look sad, or are too pricy. This just helps assure me that I still have my staples. I've been meaning to do my own hydrating for a few years now, but haven't taken the plunge. In the mean time, I stock up on what is commercially available. I like this brand, and may consider more but it can't be from Amazon.<br /><br />Spinach is a favorite for amping up the healthy aspect of a meal.

3136,5.0,UPDATED!  I LOVE THIS!  It Came Through Where Other Containers Have Not For Me!!!,"(THIS IS AN IN DEPTH REVIEW- If you prefer to have a brief summary, see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE)<br /><br />UPDATE (June 22 2017)<br />I am putting my update first (usually I put it at the end) because I have developed a whole new love for this bottle.  It came through where no other bottle I have would have come close to this performance.<br /><br />MY SITUATION<br />I was embarking on a very specific liver/gallbladder cleanse which I needed to do badly.  This involved six days of drinking two different solutions in addition to very specific eating plan.  The first liquid mixture was raw apple cider vinegar in purified water, and the other was the same with the addition of liver supporting herbal extracts.<br /><br />In order to do this, I had to drink from each liquid at various times during the day.  That is fine if you are home, but I had to be on the road two different times during this period.  In addition to that, the weather was brutal.  The temperature was in the upper 90s and inside the car much hotter.  I did not have a container that would house these things and keep them cold in the car.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE IN EXTREME HEAT<br />Then I remembered this.  I used this bottle and the sister bottle from the same company with the flip top lid to contain the raw apple cider and purified water mixture.  I put in refrigerator cold liquid in the morning and by mid afternoon, even with half of the liquid gone- THE LIQUID WAS STILL REASONABLY COLD!<br /><br />I came home and by the end of the day, what was left in the container, although not a lot was still COOL- despite being in a very hot car most of the day.<br /><br />MORE ENTHUSIASTIC RATING THAN BEFORE<br />I have developed a whole new level of appreciation for this bottle.  It is perfection for keeping things cold that I really can not transport any other way.  If I could give this 10 stars I would.<br /><br />BACK TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I originally got this to transport my filtered water in the summer when I really want a cool drink of water on the go.  I was not as interested in the hot capabilities, although it does work for that.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS CONTAINER LIKE?<br />This container is clearly a double walled bottle with a narrow neck of about 1 3/8 inches diameter.  The bottle itself is about 2 5/8 inches in diameter at the bottom.  The height is a little over 10 1/2 inches high with the lid on.<br /><br />The container itself is clearly two walled.  It has a cover on it which has a silicone plug that pushes in to seal it.  The outside has a clear rim that goes on the outside of the opening when you push in the lid.  When you want to make this transportable, you twist it to the left and it will lock it.  If you want to open it, you twist it to the right.  The directions are CLEARLY marked on the lid in case you forget.  The bottle itself is lightweight and not too heavy when empty.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS BOTTLE PERFORM?<br />I really wanted this bottle to transport cold filtered water from home when I want to go somewhere and I want to have cold water on the go.  I did not have a need for hot liquids as I have other thermos type devices for that.  However, for both hot and cold liquids this does keep things temperature for several hours.<br /><br />When used for cold, if I put cold water or ice inside, the ice is still there in a few hours and the liquid is ice.  If I just put in cold water with no ice, it is still reasonably cool after a few hours depending on the heat outside.  We have not had any hot weather yet, so those time marks will change as the seasons do.<br /><br />For hot, if I put in very hot tea or coffee, it stays hot for several hours, although it has cooled a bit by the third hour.  Again this depends on the outside temperature that it is kept at in the meanwhile.  When kept in a warm area, the time is a bit longer.  I prefer to drink this in a cup, however, not out of the container as with a coffee travel mug.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I do not really like to put coffee in this, as it leaves oils in which could be difficult to clean.  The neck is so narrow that you will have to have a rounded brush to clean it on the inside.  For hot water for tea it is great, or if I use a rounded brush, I could use it for coffee as an emergency measure.  Soapy water rinsed around in it and then emptied out and then rinsed a lot usually will clean it, but anything with milk in it, be sure to give it special care.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Great for cold or hot beverages, this little bottle keeps things at temperature for a few hours.  It is rugged, easy to transport, and does lock shut.  As long as you have a bottle brush that will fit into this bottle, you can use this for all sorts of beverages.  If not, stick to things without dairy or heavy on flavored oils.  This fits nicely in the car beverage holder and is great to have.  FIVE STARS for this.

Which is what I am back to doing. The fact that the sheet is shorter than advertised, which made my sleeping pad bunch up a little bit all on its own, did not help matters. Using it just as the sheet alone was ok, but I’m not paying $43 for a thin sheet.<br />——————original review——————-<br />For $43, this seems pretty overpriced. It’s also shorter than advertised. My sleeping pad is the exact dimension of length and width that this says it will accommodate, but it’s too short. And my pad is only an inch thick so there should have been fabric to spare. It does make it more comfortable, but it looks like crap with the pad being all wavy since it’s scrunched up inside the cover.

3172,5.0,"Super comfortable pack for walking, biking, or hiking; cavernous cargo space","[[VIDEOID:4efefdd0a4252dd270b43bf5abf224e1]] I have three hydration packs (see list below). Of the two I tested so far, I love this one the best. Note that this pack also does not come with instructions and I found that none of them do.<br /><br />1 - This one - [[ASIN:B07MR4GJL8 Thule (pronounced Toolie) Uptake Hydration Pack, 8L with 2.5L Hydrapak--about 85 fluid ounces]] - superb pack; 5 stars<br />2 -  [[ASIN:B07GHR1RSQ Osprey Women's Salida 8 (about 85 ounces)]] - excellent pack; 4 stars<br />3 - [[ASIN:B07HJVD4GX CamelBak M.U.L.E. LR 15 100oz]] - I have not tested this one yet<br /><br />After using this Thule, I absolutely love it even more than my Osprey. It is extremely well designed, comfortable, and stylish and has a cavernous interior for storage.<br /><br />PROS<br />- There are several loops all over the pack including one on the bottom that can be used to affix a bike light, hang a helmet with a carbiner, etc.<br /><br />- There's an outer zippered pocket to store small items such as a cell phone, Chapstick, tissues, etc.<br /><br />- The main pocket has one mesh zippered pocket next to the hydration bladder that can be used for a cell phone or similarly sized items. There is a large storage area in front of that for a wallet, shirt, or other personal effects for the day.<br /><br />- Behind the inner zippered pocket is the compartment for the hydration bladder.<br /><br />- The hydration bladder is 2.5L or about 85 ounces. The pack has a tiny cloth loop that holds the bladder upright when full so that it does not sink to the bottom of the pack. All I had to do was unhook the bladder, slide off the clip, pull it apart like a Zip-lock bag, then fold over with the tracks facing outward, and slip on the clip to close. Note that it is possible to fold the bladder the wrong way. Make sure the fold has the tracks facing out on both sides. Once the bladder is closed, re-attach it to the cloth loop.<br /><br />- The pack has adjustable waist and chest belts.<br /><br />- The tubing to the reservoir has a magnetic track that keeps it in place along the chest area of the pack. This is absolutely wonderful even though the track and bite valve faces down and not up toward the mouth. Therefore, when biking, one has to grab the tubing to drink. There is also another loop and clip through which the tubing passes.<br /><br />- The bite valve is removable for drying. It also has a locking mechanism to lock it so that water does not seep out.<br /><br />- The pack has padding in the shoulder and lumbar region for extra comfort.<br /><br />CONS<br />- This comes with zero instructions but since this is not my first pack, I had no trouble operating this pack.<br /><br />- My major complaint is that the water coming out of the bladder tastes awful. It tastes like a new shower curtain smells. I was told that I could partially fill the bladder with water and squeeze lemon juice into it and then freeze it to get rid of the taste. I have not tried that yet. This is typical of ALL hydration bladders I tried, unfortunately.<br /><br />Overall, I love the way this pack is engineered and how comfortable it is to use. Its simplicity is its biggest virtue along with the magnetic tubing track to keep the tubing in place. I used this once so far on a two-hour walk and I did not even know I was wearing this. The bite value is easily accessible but does face down. This means a biker would have to grab it and bring it toward the mouth to use.  Drying the bladder between use requires that I stuff the bladder mouth with a silicone ramekin and hang it upside down for several days. It takes about three to four days to dry since this hydration bladder has two halves on the interior.<br /><br />Video - My recorder is awful; I apologize for the blurriness. Please note that the hydration bladder is 2.5L and the 8L refers to the cargo space and not the reservoir.<br /><br />Photo 1 is of the specifications.<br /><br />Photos 2-5 is of the pack.<br /><br />Photo 6 shows the bladder.<br /><br />Photo 7 shows the bladder opening. Note that I inserted a Kiwi cutter into the mouth of the bladder to show where the opening is so I could take a picture.

After trying this one, I'm still looking for one.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- it's a nice bottle, attractive design, holds enough, easy to transport, and definitely leak resistant.  But drinking from it is a less-than-pleasant experience.  Somewhere either in the straw connection or the way the &#34;nipple&#34; sits on the straw-holder opening, there's an air leak, so when you suck, you get not only liquid (yay!) but also air (uh-oh).  It makes for a noisy experience and a lot of air swallowing.  Not exactly a pleasant experience.<br /><br />I've tried various ways of positioning the nipple -- the design of this, by the way, is really nice - it folds down with a lid that snaps over it.  But I can't find any position that results in a tight seal with the straw opening.  It's a pity -- because I really like the look of this.<br /><br />I may have received a &#34;dud,&#34; but at least one other reviewer referenced a similar problem.

3202,3.0,Only kept my tea hot for about 3 hours; top design is interesting,"I am a bit disappointed in this tumbler because I expected it to keep my tea hot for 8 hours. The Amazon site says it keeps drinks cold for 24+ hours or hot for 8 hours"" but it only kept my tea hot for about 3 hours and that is with the top FULLY CLOSED. After 8 hours it was almost as cold as if it had been in the refrigerator. Below are my likes and dislikes about this thermos.<br /><br />LIKES<br />- The silicone bottom keeps this from sliding and enables it to stand securely in place.<br /><br />- The silicone center makes it easy to hold for drinking because my hands do not slip off the sides.<br /><br />- The top has both an open and close indicator on the rim and a directional arrow to show which way the top should be turned. Turning it further beyond the close will remove the top.<br /><br />- I love the deep blue color.<br /><br />- It does come with a limited lifetime warranty but I doubt it is financially sensible to use since one has to mail it back.<br /><br />DISLIKES<br />- The contents do not stay hot for longer than 3 hours.<br /><br />- I am unsure if the plastic holes in the two arms on the top and the arms itself will bend and wear out over time. If those arms break that keep the top in its track, then this tumbler will become useless as a tumbler. It will then become a cup. I think these plastic arms are its breaking point.<br /><br />In summary, this is a decent tumbler if one will be drinking their hot contents within about 3 hours. Any longer than 3 hours causes the contents to cool and become lukewarm to cold EVEN if the top is fully sealed--which mine was.

3203,3.0,Eight-Inch Loops Are Too Short for Adult Use,"This THERABAND RESISTANCE BAND LOOP SET (Pack of Four 8-Inch Loops) consists of four short (8”) elastic bands that provide four different levels of resistance for use in rehabilitation or workout exercises.  Yellow requires the least amount of strength for expansion; blue, the most.<br /><br />The resistance in these bands seems to be the same as the resistance you get when you purchase lengths of yellow, red, green, and blue therapeutic elastic in a medical supply store.  It’s nice to have a set of the different-colored bands, because you are expected to move from lower to higher resistance as your strength improves with regular exercise.<br /><br />While it’s convenient to purchase the elastic in loops--so you don’t have to knot the material to use it--you do need bands that are the right length for you.  These bands are only 8” long when laid flat (there is a total of 16” of material).  Thus they are far too short for adult use, and I wonder whether they are long enough for use by any but very small children.<br /><br />The bands arrive wrapped around a brochure that has excellent explanations and photos of various exercises that can be done with resistance bands.  Mysteriously, the brochure shows adults performing the exercises--and as previously noted, these bands are too short for adult use.",1,"['resistance', 'band', 'loop', 'set', 'pack', 'four', 'inch', 'loop', 'four', 'short', 'elastic', 'band', 'provide', 'four', 'different', 'level', 'resistance', 'use', 'workout', 'exercise', 'yellow', 'requires', 'least', 'amount', 'strength', 'blue', 'resistance', 'band', 'seems', 'resistance', 'get', 'purchase', 'length', 'yellow', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'elastic', 'store', 'nice', 'set', 'different', 'band', 'expected', 'move', 'lower', 'higher', 'resistance', 'strength', 'regular', 'exercise', 'purchase', 'elastic', 'loop', 'material', 'use', 'need', 'band', 'right', 'length', 'band', 'long', 'flat', 'total', 'material', 'far', 'short', 'adult', 'use', 'long', 'enough', 'use', 'small', 'child', 'band', 'around', 'excellent', 'photo', 'various', 'exercise', 'done', 'resistance', 'band', 'show', 'adult', 'exercise', 'band', 'short', 'adult', 'use']"

3236,2.0,For an adult- NO. For a child-YES.,"I was extremely disappointed when I received the Kohree Folding Stool/Portable Camping Stool (for Fishing, Hiking, Gardening & Beach). My husband and teenaged son love FISHING. They are also very serious about the sport and are constantly looking for ways to make their hobby more enjoyable, easier. So when offered this stool, I jumped on it. I thought from the description that was given that it would be perfect. However, it was tiny. Way too small to be of any real use.  My seventeen-year-old son is 6’3 and 160lbs. Unfortunately, it is too low to the ground for him to attempt to sit comfortably in.  My husband is 6’, 220lbs and said that he would only rest his feet on it, while he sits in a regular sized chair. Again, the complaint was that it was too short to comfortably sit on. So, I thought that I would try. I am average sized, about 5’4 (and I’m not telling my weight) and even I found it to be uncomfortable. Number one, at my age, anything that taxes my knees isn’t worth it. If you are average to tall, your legs will not be comfortable (for long periods of time) in a squat position or straight out. Remember fishing takes time and patience, so I can’t imagine sitting on this for more than 5 minutes. And because there is no back to it, there is also no support. With all that being said, I do have a few positive things to say about this stool. (1) I do think you could place a tackle box on top of it. (2) If you have a child under 2, but no older than 4, they would love this chair. They could sit comfortably in it and enjoy helping in the garden, playing on the beach and fishing. (3) I do like this chair comes with a cute little drawstring carry bag with a strap. And (4) this chair is light and easy to carry. Overall, I do think that this is a cute concept, but I don’t think it should be marketed as an adult stool. It isn’t even big enough for a pre-teen.",1,"['extremely', 'disappointed', 'received', 'folding', 'portable', 'camping', 'fishing', 'hiking', 'beach', 'husband', 'son', 'love', 'fishing', 'also', 'serious', 'looking', 'way', 'make', 'easier', 'thought', 'description', 'given', 'perfect', 'however', 'tiny', 'way', 'small', 'real', 'use', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'unfortunately', 'low', 'ground', 'sit', 'comfortably', 'husband', 'said', 'rest', 'foot', 'regular', 'sized', 'chair', 'complaint', 'short', 'comfortably', 'sit', 'thought', 'try', 'average', 'sized', 'weight', 'even', 'found', 'uncomfortable', 'number', 'one', 'age', 'anything', 'knee', 'isn', 'worth', 'average', 'tall', 'leg', 'comfortable', 'long', 'time', 'position', 'straight', 'remember', 'fishing', 'take', 'time', 'sitting', 'minute', 'back', 'also', 'support', 'said', 'thing', 'say', 'think', 'place', 'box', 'top', 'child', 'older', 'love', 'chair', 'sit', 'comfortably', 'enjoy', 'playing', 'beach', 'fishing', 'like', 'chair', 'come', 'cute', 'little', 'carry', 'bag', 'strap', 'chair', 'light', 'easy', 'carry', 'overall', 'think', 'cute', 'concept', 'think', 'adult', 'isn', 'even', 'big', 'enough']"
3237,4.0,Nice quality.,"I ordered the 'EMSWD 2019 Upgrade Handlebar Extension Knee Bar for Segway miniPRO/miniLITE/ninebot minipro/2019 Segway-Ninebot Ninebot S.' for review but unfortunately it did not fit my Segway Ninebot S Plus so I will base my review off of the quality and construction of the bar itself and the included mobile mount.<br /><br />I was pretty excited to try this Extension bar for my Ninebot S Plus however I was not able to fully install because I have the Plus version, and I was not able to get this kit to work with it. The Plus has a really nice knee bar that also has a light. After some trial and error I finally decided that I would just base this review purely on the quality and construction of the Handlebar which is a pretty decent quality. The handlebars have a nice padded grip and everything to do with the kit was super easy to assemble. This kit also comes with a mounting kit for your mobile phone which actually is pretty nice on it's own. I may use this on my mountain bike as it is much better than the current mounting kit I am using haha. It is not based on springs to hold your mobile in place. It actually tightens down via a screw mechanism which you can then lock into place. if there were to be any issue or concern with this kit, it would be the fact that the hardware used to tighten the two pieces together are plastic. These are just the clamping brackets and personally when I assembled the kit, there were no issues with the said clamping brackets. They fit very snug and clamped shut and secure, so unless you were to take the kit apart and put it together many times over, there shouldn't be an issue at all. Overall, I think this is a nice quality kit and I wish that I would have paid more attention to the description before ordering as this would have maybe been a way to get my wife to ride our Ninebot S Plus haha.",0,"['ordered', 'handlebar', 'knee', 'bar', 'review', 'unfortunately', 'fit', 'plus', 'base', 'review', 'quality', 'construction', 'bar', 'included', 'mount', 'pretty', 'excited', 'try', 'bar', 'plus', 'however', 'able', 'fully', 'install', 'plus', 'version', 'able', 'get', 'kit', 'work', 'plus', 'really', 'nice', 'knee', 'bar', 'also', 'light', 'finally', 'decided', 'base', 'review', 'quality', 'construction', 'handlebar', 'pretty', 'decent', 'quality', 'handlebar', 'nice', 'grip', 'everything', 'kit', 'super', 'easy', 'assemble', 'kit', 'also', 'come', 'kit', 'phone', 'actually', 'pretty', 'nice', 'may', 'use', 'mountain', 'bike', 'much', 'better', 'current', 'kit', 'using', 'based', 'spring', 'hold', 'place', 'actually', 'screw', 'lock', 'place', 'issue', 'concern', 'kit', 'fact', 'used', 'tighten', 'two', 'piece', 'together', 'plastic', 'personally', 'assembled', 'kit', 'issue', 'said', 'fit', 'snug', 'secure', 'unless', 'take', 'kit', 'apart', 'put', 'together', 'many', 'time', 'issue', 'overall', 'think', 'nice', 'quality', 'kit', 'wish', 'paid', 'description', 'maybe', 'way', 'get', 'wife', 'ride', 'plus']"

3297,5.0,Osprey Rook 50 is the Deluxe Backpack I was Looking for,"If there is one thing I want to do more of this year, it’s hiking. Whether it’s a short hike in a nearby park or a longer hike lasting multiple hours in an open wilderness, I want to get outdoors more than in the past. For this reason, I now have an assortment of backpacks and the latest addition to my arsenal is Osprey Rook 50 Backpacking Pack.<br /><br />I needed a larger backpack, capable of holding more items and with more versatility. My other backpacks are generally simplistic in design and not made to handle much more than what you would need for about three or four hours. Osprey Rook 50 Backpacking Pack was the larger addition I was looking for. It has a more rigid design with a solid backing and multiple compartments, including one that can hold a sleeping bag. The mesh side pockets and hip belt pockets provide the space you need for a serious hike. And there are multiple pockets overall, perfect for organizing the different extras necessary for a serious expedition.<br /><br />As for comfort, this one scores good marks. I wasn’t so sure the first time I tried it on for size. I had trouble removing it, but that is because, well, I’m not as flexible as I once was and I didn’t adjust the straps first. That made putting I on easy, but taking it off was a different matter. Once I realized my mistake and adjusted the straps as needed, I didn’t have any trouble at all. I admit, this backpack does feel different from my other backpacks, most of which are not rigid in construction and are more or less collapsible. This Osprey Backpack feels different, but this is to be expected, since it is capable of so much more than others.<br /><br />This backpack is lightweight for its size. I like the ventilated mesh backing- it’s a trampoline style mesh and it helps with airflow, which is good when you live in a hot climate like mine and need any assistance you can get to stay cool. It has a rain cover, too, and multiple ways to adjust the straps for the perfect fit.<br /><br />Hiking is slowing turning into a regular occurrence for me. I have joined a few groups that do regular day hikes across the city, as well as longer hikes on weekend. I liked having an assortment of backpacks and the Osprey Rook 50 Backpacking Pack is a most excellent addition to my collection.

3347,5.0,Fine Rod/Reel Combo,"I have for years loved fishing and I still have my original fishing reel, a vintage Zebco 33 that still works and I still use on occasion. I have been through countless rods, though. I selected this combo set with my son in mind who prefers the spincasting design of reels, and so far he and I are both pleased with this combo. It seems to be made well and it is well suited for most freshwater fishing.<br /><br />The reel is an updated Zebco 33, a step forward from my old vintage model in terms of smoothness and operation, though the functionality is basically the same. Push the button to release line for casting, and start reeling to retrieve. It has a solid anti-reverse (though not a zero-reverse clutch). And, the drag is set via a thumb wheel that is easy to turn. This reel has two advantages over its older sibling: it has a nice, large handle so the retrieve is a lot faster, and the handle is reversible so it can be used by anyone and not just right-handers like me.<br /><br />The rod is a nice, medium-action rod that will hold up well to decent-sized fighting fish. It assembles easily and the eyes are all-metal.<br /><br />Casting is smooth and easy with this combo. The reel itself is a smooth operator and so far I have had no hang-ups with the cast. The rod does well in casting too, and even though the eyes are very simple the line glides easily through and we have seen no issues with the line catching or being slowed down through the rod’s eyes.<br /><br />So far, we have no complaints with this combo and we’re already looking forward to more time on the lake with it.

3348,3.0,Professional? Not Quite.,"I like bocce and I was thrilled to have the opportunity to review this set. I was particularly interested in this set because it is marketed as a “professional” set. As a casual bocce set this is great, but as a professional set it’s out of specifications, by more than a little. Since it is priced as a professional set, it misses the mark, though it is fine for casual and family play.<br /><br />I decided to do a little digging to see what would designate a bocce set as a “professional” set. According to the Bocce Standards Association (yes, seriously), each ball should be a specific size and weight. Of interest is the weight range: 920g +/- 10g (2 lbs.). That’s a tight range of weights, though for sporting equipment used in professional or tournament play that’s not unusual. I measured all 8 balls on a calibrated scale, set to measure in grams. The lightest ball in my set is 947g, and the heaviest is 1026g (2.25 lbs.). Every single ball is outside of the range. I could see being a little outside of the range, but over 100g is way off. Since the spread between the highest and lowest in my set is about 80g, and the specifications allow for a 20g spread between the extremes, this is not a scale problem. Most players wouldn’t even notice, but that’s not the point.<br /><br />As a casual set, this is a fine bocce set and should last for years. The balls are solid and made of some form of resin, are consistent in appearance and though do get surface scratches during play and transport (very normal), they’re rugged and should not break, crack or chip unless abused or purposely damaged. The set comes in a nylon carry bag and includes a rule book.<br /><br />This is a nice casual set, not a professional set. The balls are out of spec which makes it unsuitable for true tournament play. And as a casual set, it’s a bit expensive.",1,"['like', 'review', 'set', 'set', 'set', 'set', 'great', 'set', 'little', 'since', 'priced', 'set', 'mark', 'though', 'fine', 'family', 'play', 'decided', 'little', 'see', 'set', 'set', 'standard', 'yes', 'ball', 'size', 'weight', 'weight', 'range', 'tight', 'range', 'weight', 'though', 'equipment', 'used', 'play', 'ball', 'set', 'ball', 'set', 'every', 'single', 'ball', 'outside', 'range', 'see', 'little', 'outside', 'range', 'way', 'since', 'set', 'allow', 'problem', 'even', 'notice', 'point', 'set', 'fine', 'set', 'last', 'year', 'ball', 'solid', 'made', 'though', 'get', 'surface', 'play', 'normal', 'break', 'unless', 'set', 'come', 'carry', 'bag', 'nice', 'set', 'set', 'ball', 'make', 'true', 'play', 'set', 'bit', 'expensive']"

3410,5.0,'SalGoodMan,"this optic (along with all the other Hardline, Brushline and the Pro equivalents) is made int the Philippines - the ""little"" country that could. The craftsmanship is par with that of Nikon and Vortex and the glass, well in my opinion, it's actually slightly better than Nikon. If I had any criticisms it would be that the reticle’s height indicators on the rimfire model are a bit too small – they need to be beefed up a bit, and secondly, no parallax adjustment and no reticle illumination. But the knob modulations for both windage and height are uncharacteristically good for this segment as well as the glass and the finish. I paired mine with Winchester (Browning) Wildcat cause it matches the red accents – look and function in one. Add the lifetime warranty and bottom line is – you get a lot for your money.

3418,5.0,Great cleaning kit & includes a hydration bag & nice bite valve.,"For the price this is a cleaning kit with a free hydration bag.

It also comes with an expandable hanger that holds the bag open for drying.<br />The kit is complete & works well. There is really no other way to get the hose clear without the long, spring brush. I cleaned out one of my other bags with the kit & the results were satisfying if disgusting.<br />The included water bag is made of thick material which I like. The fill opening is large & internal threaded like most of the newer ones I have used. The large opening is easier to fill but hard to get full without spilling. The cap threads tightly & seals well but the strap attaching the cap is very short & pulls out every time I use it.<br />The hose has a nice quick disconnect on the bag end & a pressure fit on the bite valve end.

Both Mom and her sibling are crafters, so they are gifted with their hands and are used to putting things together. None of that mattered in this case. They never actually got the tent up. The directions were confusing. There were a lot of stakes needed for both the tent itself and the rain cover. The second photo above shows how far they got, which wasn't very far, and certainly not to the point of making the tent anywhere near usable. They never even got the rain cover on. The fabric itself was so lightweight that it doesn't seem durable at all. The instructions say not to put the tent under trees or in direct sunlight as that can damage it. Those seem like funny instructions for a camping tent. If you can't put it in direct sunlight or under any trees, just where the heck are you supposed to set it up on a camping trip?

The really really really bad part is that it doesn’t have a Picatinny rail notch meaning it is absolutely smooth as a baby’s butt on the bottom. So you cannot use this on anything that has a kick stronger than a 22 maybe even 22 mag. Because, it will start sliding back-and-forth on the rail unless you use 40 pounds torque on the screws or more. The other basic functionality failure is of the windage knob – it is labeled in reverse meaning right is left and left is right.

3536,2.0,"Assembly Required, Sub par Construction","Foosball was a huge hit in college. Who doesn’t remember knocking back a few cold ones while trying to show your masterful skills at the foosball table? Now, Franklin Sports has a scaled down version of the popular game with its 20 inch Pro Kick Foosball set.<br /><br />Due to the smaller size of this set, I figured it would be good for my kids and when I received this package in the mail, I opened the box expecting the game to be fully assembled and ready to play. It wasn’t. You have to assemble by hand and from what I discovered, the assembly is not that easy. Worse, my set was missing a few important pieces so we were unable to complete the set up until I made a quick trip to a home supply store.<br /><br />Once assembled, we started to use the game, but we soon noticed that the handles do not move back and forth very smoothly and the screws do not hold very well. The construction of the game is not the best and I really think it would be better of the manufacturer changed things up by using better quality construction. Having it packaged ready to play would be nice, but I could tolerate a little bit of home assembly if the end product was sturdier and better designed.<br /><br />Franklin Pro Kick Foosball set is too small for adults.

Big wheels roll over debris,"I'm closer to 50 years old than 40 I haven't skated since ALF was on TV but I have been eyeing the new style boards for a while now. I chose the long board style because it seemed better for riding around the neighborhood & I hoped no one would expect me to do tricks on it. As a returning rider who has been out of touch for a few decades I can't expertly critique the board but I am thoroughly enjoying it & it has good features for a street board. My daughter's boyfriend borrowed it to take to the park so it must have the right look.<br />This board is big. At 41"", it comes up to my belt when stood on end and gives a stable ride but takes a lot of space to turn. It also seems wider than I remember from my '80s boards & there is a lot of space to move around. The wheels are about 2 3/4"" in diameter which is good for rough pavement & rolling over pebbles & even the occasional stick. It's heavier than my old boards which is good for riding if not carrying.<br />I'm still getting the hang of ""pumping"" the board but kicking it is certainly faster than walking & a good reason to get out & around the neighborhood. I tightened the trucks to make them stiffer while I get used to it but I always preferred stiffer trucks anyway.<br />The deck is thick, 1/2"" plywood, the top is completely covered with good grip tape & the bottom is painted. It has some concavity which helps to turn. The edges of the plywood are stained & look great except the scratches I have put on the ends.

3564,5.0,"Hiking, Camping, Emergencies, This is there for all Your Needs","My review is of the 5-liter version of the LifeStraw mission water purifier.<br /><br />Assembly and set up are unbelievably easy. Fill the roll-bag with the cleanest water you have access to. Roll, seal and hang the bag using the handy nylon strap they include. Attach the hose (which also easily detaches) and let the water begin to flow. Purge the red valve which is bad water and then wait for the water to begin flowing from the blue valve which is the good water. Detailed instructions are included and printed on the roll-bag. The kit also comes with a handy stuff sack and a couple extra primary filters which mount inside the roll-bag.<br /><br />The 5-liter size is good enough for two people, perhaps two adults and a child. For more people you're going to want the higher capacity bag or more than one of these 5-liter kits. I wanted to give this an honest trial. I almost went with the pool water but the chlorine and other chemicals worried me and after an email from the company I'm glad I didn't. Under no circumstances should you attempt to filter pool water. Luckily we received a good amount of rain. Water drains out of our neighborhood through a system of swales and where it runs across our yard we have a good grass base for it to flow across. We took our bag full of water from the front yard and followed all the instructions very carefully. After purging the red valve and bulb I filled a cup from the blue valve side and. . .  it tasted as good as the filtered water from our refrigerator. 24 hours later and no adverse effects.

3590,5.0,Very Comfortable Chair- Lacks Back Support For Some--,"I love to rock when I am outdoors.  I have had various chairs, but many lack the back support that I need.  I got this chair in hopes to finally have one that would work.  It works, but I had to put in a back support pillow.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box, well wrapped and then the bag with the frame and chair comes in that box.<br /><br />HOW TO SET UP<br />As the instructions show, the frame is easy to set up and fast.  You simply hook the chair over the hooks and are good to go.<br /><br />BACK SUPPORT<br />This is comparable to a bucket seat in a car.  Honestly for me, I need lumbar support.  For this chair, it just needs a little lumbar support.  I got a lumbar pillow and put it behind my back and I am happy.  It is comfortable.<br /><br />FOOT STOOL<br />For me, although I am long waisted and 5'7"", sitting in this chair needs to have something to put my feet on to be most comfortable. I just get something I can put my feet on even if it is a rock, and then the chair is comfortable for me to sit in for long periods of time.  Without it, it puts a little strain on my lower back.<br /><br />LEGS<br />The legs of this chair have to be on fairly even ground.  Although it can take a little variation, it is best to try for the most even ground you can.  Otherwise the strain on the frame can cause it to bend depending on how heavy the person is and how often it is used on uneven ground.<br /><br />QUALITY<br />The quality of the case, the chair, and the frame is excellent.  Workmanship is very good and the design is well executed.  This is a sturdy well made chair.  I like it.<br /><br />DOES IT HAVE CUP HOLDERS?<br />There are not any cup holders on this chair.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Well made with a great storage/carry bag, this chair is comfortable.  I needed a lumbar support pillow which I tucked in with it when stored.  A foot stool of some sort helps too.  Great chair and we all love it.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is way nicer than I expected and I am glad we got it.  It is a good addition to our camping/roughing it collection.

Maybe its just mine - who knows, but I really do not want to spend $$$ on another one just to find out.  My previous Yeti’s (the ones with a straw) did a fantastic job.

3619,4.0,Good For The Beach,"This is a nice water shirt that will help keep you comfortable and prevent sunburn while you're out on a lake, river, or beach. It is a quick-dry, lightweight shirt that is made from 100% polyester. Note that the shirt is not made out of swimsuit material, but is more like a quick-dry running shirt. The material is a little bit stretchy but is not nearly as elastic as Lycra or Spandex. The colors are attractive and the shirt fits true to size. If you are between sizes, you should select the larger shirt here so it's easier to pull on and off when it becomes damp. You can kind of see through the material so it's best to wear a swimsuit beneath it. The shirt is nice to swim in, and provides a more modest, yet still attractive look. This would be a great option for people who perform aqua yoga.

3669,3.0,"Bottle is Great; Need a Better Way to Flush the Filter for Use, Though","I have been using a Brita squeeze bottle for a couple of years and it has been great when on trips. I definitely have saved money by replacing filters instead of plastic water bottles. I was interested in using this hard bottle from Brita, as using a straw-type nozzle is a lot easier than using a bottle you have to squeeze. The bottle is good and it’s designed well, But, there’s one glaring issue with this bottle.<br /><br />This is a hard bottle that is resistant to drops and scratches, and will bounce when dropped from sufficient height without breaking.<br /><br />I like the fact that the cap pops up to reveal a silicone straw, and the bottle has an insert in it that allows the drinker to pull up water from the bottom without  inverting the bottle. This is a nice change from how the squeeze bottle is used, which must be inverted. Flow is easy too – the water comes out with little effort.<br /><br />So, Brita left out one very important detail. The filters for these bottles are a charcoal cylinder through which water is forced, and it is normal to get charcoal dust out of the filter when it’s flushed before first use. So, when using the squeeze bottles, Brita says to flush the filter by filling the bottle and forcing the water through, discarding that first bottle full. This bottle cannot be squeezed, and there are no instructions in the package on how to flush the filter for use with it. Following the instructions with the product description, I flushed the filter under running water for 15 seconds. I then put the filter in my squeeze bottle, and when I forced the water through it initially came out purple-ish black as expected. After it was flushed, there was no more charcoal dust and it was ready for this bottle. Is the user expected to flush the filter by spitting out that first bottle full? I hope not, but without instructions saying otherwise there’s little alternative. The charcoal is not dangerous, of course, but it’s very unappetizing.<br /><br />This is actually a great bottle and Brita did a good job with it. The issue is with the lack of ability to flush the filter to clear out the charcoal dust. There either needs to be a better instruction set to explain, or there needs to be a tool in the box for properly flushing the filter. If Brita can resolve this problem, this would be a very easy recommend; as it stands, I have reservations about that unless there’s a way to flush the filter without relying on another bottle to do it.",1,"['using', 'bottle', 'couple', 'year', 'great', 'trip', 'definitely', 'money', 'filter', 'instead', 'plastic', 'water', 'bottle', 'using', 'hard', 'bottle', 'using', 'straw', 'type', 'lot', 'easier', 'using', 'bottle', 'bottle', 'good', 'designed', 'well', 'one', 'issue', 'bottle', 'hard', 'bottle', 'resistant', 'drop', 'height', 'without', 'like', 'fact', 'cap', 'pop', 'silicone', 'straw', 'bottle', 'insert', 'allows', 'pull', 'water', 'bottom', 'without', 'bottle', 'nice', 'change', 'bottle', 'used', 'must', 'easy', 'water', 'come', 'little', 'effort', 'left', 'one', 'important', 'filter', 'bottle', 'water', 'normal', 'get', 'filter', 'first', 'use', 'using', 'bottle', 'say', 'filter', 'bottle', 'water', 'first', 'bottle', 'full', 'bottle', 'instruction', 'package', 'filter', 'use', 'instruction', 'product', 'description', 'filter', 'running', 'water', 'second', 'put', 'filter', 'bottle', 'water', 'came', 'black', 'expected', 'ready', 'bottle', 'user', 'expected', 'filter', 'first', 'bottle', 'full', 'hope', 'without', 'instruction', 'otherwise', 'little', 'course', 'actually', 'great', 'bottle', 'good', 'job', 'issue', 'lack', 'ability', 'filter', 'clear', 'either', 'need', 'better', 'instruction', 'set', 'need', 'tool', 'box', 'properly', 'filter', 'problem', 'easy', 'recommend', 'stand', 'unless', 'way', 'filter', 'without', 'another', 'bottle']"

It requires the use of an app to control it. My husband and my 17 year old daughter have both downloaded and are the primary users. When riding in the house, they were riding on tile, hardwood, and carpet. The Segway moved over all three surfaces easily and without any hesitations. It went over the transitions smoothly. I was surprised at how fast they were able to go inside the house.<br /><br />Once the weather was nicer, they took it outside. We live in a small neighborhood with minimal traffic. They have enjoyed riding in the street as well as the driveway. The app limits the speed based on how much driving you've done. The more experienced you are, the faster you are permitted to go.<br /><br />It has headlights and rear colored lights. You control the hover board with your balance and leaning. My husband says if you think too much about it, it's difficult to control.

A lot of water bottles these days don't fit. The lid screws securely and doesn't leak. It is a little hard to get the ice cubes into mouth of the bottle. I find that it works best if I put in the cubes one at a time which can be a little time consuming. It does an excellent job of keeping the water chilled. There's always plenty of ice left at the end of the day. It fits pretty well into your hand.

(2) Apparently there are health benefits from drinking water out of a copper infused container.  (3) It is easy to clean. I hand wash after adding a mild detergent with a gentle brush. And (4) it fits in a traditional cup holder (car). The bad thing(s): (1) The lid is difficult to get on and off. I am not sure what I will have to do to correct this. It is really annoying. (2) If you place cold water in this container, it doesn’t stay cold. Even if you add ice. So, taking this to the gym will not work for some. Most want cool, refreshing water after working out.

3747,4.0,longboard daddy-O and the bamboo bamboozler that sheds the lbs while I shreds all  'round,"So, I am not joing when I say ,"" I am old-school"" I have actually skated a drainage ditch with Stacy Peralta back in early 80's on my old PowellPeralta Bones I with all the accoutrements  ; I was a punk that was in the right place , it seems, at right time for about 20 years and skated for about a decade of those.<br />25-30 years later, I am still thin and athletic; it pisses some folks off that I wear same pants I wore in tenth grade but LATELY I have noticed I am gaining a we bit and getting some flab that I have never had; So, in order to counter balance my engineering jobs required ' sit at computer desk for 10 hours per day"" + my age I also wanted to be able to do something with my young kids that like to bike around . So, I o hunting a reasonably priced ( in case I broke something or hated it- like that could happen) long board to carve some while hanging with my kids. We have a deserted mall that has a mile and a half of empty parking lot and traffic-less road around it right down the street. So I thought I would 'test' my old love of riding with the slower, safer, more controlled for my age version of thrashing; long-board riding.<br />Well, let me tell you something; I was far far far off the mark; there isn't anything 'slow' about long boarding these days. In fact , the current trend is to go as freaking fast as you can and have a durometer wheel that is just right so-as to allow you to ( gasp) break the grip and slide on your darned wheels! It is called ;Free-riding' and / or sliding/ carving/ speed skating....depending on what you prefer & the terrain.<br /> I like to freeride. I got a week in and realized that, while this thing was flexy enough for my 6' frame + 155lb body, to slide like I was seeing on video's , I needed wheels and bearing and bushings of higher quality,so I got some Bones Reds, a set of 82a durometer wider flat big 72mm wheels of ""For ya Momma "" wheels and proceeded to do my night riding on this setup. Talk about freaking more grip! to break and slide at my weight requires a bit more speed and a bit harder wheel. I fell at around 2am one evening ( lost 6 lbs after 4 weeks and have my abs back!) and slid with no protection on asphalt for approx 25 yards. The Helmet and pads arrived the next day. I still hurt from that one. but this board has no damage at all a, is tough as crap because of bamboo/maple/bamboo/maple/bamboo/maple/bamboo layering and also I was pleasantly surprised to find not just the kick-tail rear but a slight one frontside. Once I got some Orangutang 86a and 65mm Fat Free wheels I can use those, the Venom cone bushings and my uber fast bearings to fly like an eagle and break this sucker into a slide like I was born to do so. I am nearing a full 360 - no stop slide around and I can do the ColeySlide or whatever. My old skills from the 80's are still there and it makes my kids laugh their butts off to see a 45 year old Dad Ollie up a curb or front stand this monster. Did I mention it is REALLY long? like, it is taller than my 7 year old son. I strap it to my HiLift jack on back of my Jeep JK and most folks my age either scoff at my frivolity or jealously ogle the thing.<br />As I said, exercise is vital; I lost ten pounds and can really skate quite well. This thing will need more grip tape and trucks before the board is wasted it is so tough. A GREAT GREAT GREAT deal for a beginners long board and it looks bad @ssed, too. Just prepare to get better wheels ( the ones it comes with are great but just kinda middle ground...not too soft/not too hard, not to big not to small....replace em) some bearings and maybe bushings . Then go and freeride the night away . Oh, wear a damned helmet or you'll wind up typing crazy ass reviews like this , possibly.<br />This board kicks boot-ay. Worth every penny. I rock the Quest, and you should too.<br /><br />( my setup suggestion is Orangutang Fat Free 83a - 86a , 65mm wheels . Get the best bearings you can afford- Bones Swiss are tops but I have also gotten a great ride from old worn in Speedy Lunatic ABEC3's I had from long ago; I just put precision speed lube in em. Also, depending on your weight, a more conical bushing allows for easier turning; but the ones this comes with are fine.

While the assembly was easy, there are a few flaws with it. The description says that you can fill the base with water or sand. It is just a flat piece of metal, therefore you cannot add water or sand to it. The rubber suction cups on the bottom of it don’t really stick to well to a tile floor. With one good hit, it will go tumbling over. Also, you cannot use on carpet or grass. It would need to be on a hard surface in order to get the suction cups to stick. One last thing is that the screws are at the top near the punching bag itself. If you miss the hit and hit your hands on the screws, it could result in an injury.

From there- look ant the end you insert the pin.. it has a “set arrow” for you to twist. Turn each dial to the number chosen for your personal combination - WRITE IT DOWN!

But in reality it just means these goggles come apart every time you try and put them on your child's head. Every time. They just pop apart as soon as you try and stretch him. I had also hoped that the extra wide band with the grippy things on the back would actually hold the goggles on his head since his other goggles always slide down, but no such luck! These goggles slide right down his head too. Which means he leaves them on for all of about 2 minutes before he wants them off again. They also don't fit his face well and therefore the water just pours in. They literally lasted about 5 minutes at the pool and then have sat at the bottom of the pool bag on each trip to the pool after that. They are completely useless. They do come in a nice case and include the extra nose pieces and what I believe to be earplugs, though we had no need to even try those out.

There's also a nice hook that latches to keep the window from opening accidentally.<br /><br />It's currently hanging in the kids' room where they can look at the pins they acquired by trading and buying.",0,"['easy', 'hang', 'pin', 'others', 'back', 'easy', 'stick', 'remove', 'pin', 'pin', 'stuck', 'falling', 'easy', 'enough', 'pull', 'move', 'window', 'super', 'clear', 'though', 'take', 'also', 'nice', 'hook', 'keep', 'window', 'opening', 'kid', 'room', 'look', 'pin', 'buying']"

And, oddly enough, I could have sworn I tasted cinnamon but according to the ingredients list there is no cinnamon in them.

3809,4.0,"Pretty and Waterproof, but Very Thin","My wife and I like a good picnic and while we do not get to go as often as we would like, we go when we can and we have a good time. I have an actual picnic basket with a red and white checkerboard tarp which is ok but it is not very large and not insulated enough to provide any cushion from the ground. I looked to this blanket as a possible solution. It’s very attractive and it is very clearly a good water barrier, but it offers nothing in the way of padding or insulation.<br /><br />This is a large blanket, roughly 6'x4.5', which is quite a lot larger than others I have used. It has a very pretty blue plaid pattern and it folds up very compactly so that it is about the size of a handbag. Being so compact it can be packed up and taken anywhere, and the only thing it lacks is a handle to make it even easier to carry though not having a handle is hardly a problem.<br /><br />The back of this blanket is a hard, semi-smooth material somewhat resembling vinyl but more rugged (it is more like a grilling mat). This provides a great barrier against moisture and protects even when put on a very shallow bit of standing water (though the top will get wet not by soak-through but by submersion).<br /><br />My main complaint with this blanket is that it is so thin and lightweight that it really does not provide any insulation on hard ground. I was hopeful that it would be more like a thin layer of wool but it’s more like a sheet of material bonded to a plastic backing. That is the sacrifice made to make this so easy to compact.<br /><br />This is not a bad blanket by any means. It is a good blanket if you need something that can seat several people and it is very pretty. That said, do not expect much in the way of cushion with it. It’s a great choice if you want to sit on damp ground and if you need to pack it for a trip and are short on room.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

3810,3.0,"Faulty stitching, poor window design","Let me preface my review by saying that I absolutely HATE tent camping. However, there are places in the Big Bend region of Texas that you can only access by horseback or on foot. And that requires tent camping. I ride.<br /><br />After 4 nights in the northern most reaches of Big Bend Ranch State Park, using this tent, I have not revised my opinion of tent camping in general. I made base camp in a remote, long unused old ranch camp which offered a covered 2 sided shed to put the tent under. It was 103 on day 2, so shade is critical. Rain wasn't a concern at all, so I cannot speak to the tent's ability to stay dry inside or not.<br /><br />It is perfectly capable of staying stupid hot though. The window covers don't roll up properly or stay up when you manage to finagle them up. So any breeze passing by, passes you by.<br /><br />Additionally, the hook at the center top for a fan or lantern was already coming unstitched the first night. Fortunately, I was sleeping outside where it was cooler when the lantern fell.<br /><br />Those two issues aside, the tent weighs very little. It pops up and is fully supported in a minute with little effort at all. Taking it down on day 5 was equally simple. It's not really a 3 person tent unless you're tiny people who really like to snuggle.",1,"['let', 'review', 'absolutely', 'tent', 'camping', 'however', 'place', 'big', 'foot', 'requires', 'tent', 'camping', 'ride', 'night', 'reach', 'big', 'state', 'using', 'tent', 'opinion', 'tent', 'camping', 'made', 'base', 'camp', 'long', 'old', 'camp', 'put', 'tent', 'day', 'rain', 'concern', 'tent', 'ability', 'stay', 'dry', 'inside', 'perfectly', 'hot', 'though', 'window', 'cover', 'roll', 'properly', 'stay', 'hook', 'center', 'top', 'fan', 'lantern', 'already', 'coming', 'first', 'night', 'sleeping', 'outside', 'cooler', 'lantern', 'fell', 'two', 'issue', 'tent', 'little', 'pop', 'fully', 'minute', 'little', 'effort', 'taking', 'day', 'simple', 'really', 'person', 'tent', 'unless', 'tiny', 'people', 'really', 'like']"

3827,5.0,Portable and Lightweight,"Cornhole is a fun game that brings back memories of “Toss-Across” for me. I never had heard of, or played, cornhole until it was introduced to me at a social gathering relatively recently. I have wanted my own set for taking to family functions and picnics with friends, and this set is well suited for these situations.<br /><br />I will start with this: I received the tailgate version which is a little smaller than the regulation size set. The difference is that the boards are a foot shorter. That’s ok, but it does mean that my set is not suitable for true tournament play and instead is geared for casual competition. Both sized sets are available here; make sure you get the size you want. While it may be a little smaller, it has two distinct advantages. First, it is lighter so it is easier to carry. Second, because it is smaller it is more compact and can be stored (and transported) more easily too.<br /><br />This set is made to be portable. Most sets I have seen have been made of plywood and have fixed legs. To move them is awkward and often unwieldy. This set instead has an aluminum frame and lightweight boards so the weight is substantially reduced. The legs fold under, allowing the set to lay flat. This makes it a lot easier to pack the set for travel and to store it away when not in use. An important detail – when the legs are down they lock in place with a metal bracket so the board will not collapse.<br /><br />The set comes with 8 bean bags, 4 blue and 4 red. These are regulation size and are interchangeable with other sets.<br /><br />So far my family is very pleased with this set. It is made very well, it is compact and portable, and because this set (in my case) is the tailgate version it is lighter and easier to store when not in use. This is an easy product to recommend.",0,"['fun', 'game', 'back', 'across', 'never', 'recently', 'wanted', 'set', 'taking', 'family', 'function', 'friend', 'set', 'well', 'start', 'received', 'version', 'little', 'smaller', 'size', 'set', 'difference', 'board', 'foot', 'doe', 'mean', 'set', 'true', 'play', 'instead', 'sized', 'set', 'available', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'size', 'want', 'may', 'little', 'smaller', 'two', 'first', 'lighter', 'easier', 'carry', 'second', 'smaller', 'compact', 'easily', 'set', 'made', 'portable', 'set', 'seen', 'made', 'fixed', 'leg', 'move', 'often', 'set', 'instead', 'frame', 'lightweight', 'board', 'weight', 'leg', 'fold', 'set', 'lay', 'flat', 'make', 'lot', 'easier', 'pack', 'set', 'travel', 'store', 'away', 'use', 'important', 'leg', 'lock', 'place', 'metal', 'board', 'set', 'come', 'bag', 'blue', 'red', 'size', 'set', 'far', 'family', 'pleased', 'set', 'made', 'well', 'compact', 'portable', 'set', 'case', 'version', 'lighter', 'easier', 'store', 'use', 'easy', 'product', 'recommend']"
3828,3.0,Basic Bag with Awkward Closure,"I like to go on short hikes and since my hikes usually vary from 3 to 10 miles, I prefer to have an assortment of backpacks to fit the need. One thing I lack is a lighter, smaller, more basic backpack and this need convinced me to add this CBRSports bag to my backpack collection.<br /><br />As for the size of this backpack, it is about what I expected. The 25 liter capacity makes it smaller than most of my other backpacks, but still large enough that it can handle what I need for a hike of a few hours. It doesn’t have tons of pockets and compartments. It is more basic, so it works well when basic is all I need. And it is easily foldable and lightweight, so you can store it most anyplace.<br /><br />This sports bag passes the size test for a short hike, but there are certain aspects of the design that bother me. The most annoying is the Velcro closure. Look at the top and you will see the Velcro strips. They are on opposite sides of the bag and to use them, the only way you can make them touch is to fold and roll the top. This is quite awkward and it made me wonder if I was doing something wrong. But this is how it works. You can barely get the Velcro strips to touch and even when they do, the security is not as good as it is with other bags.<br /><br />Another issue I have with this sports bag is the smell. It’s an odd chemical/petroleum type of smell and even after a few weeks of use, it is still present. If you like the scent of gasoline, then you may not mind but I don’t like it. I am hoping that maybe it will fade over time.<br /><br />For a medium sized backpack, this CBRSports bag is a decent option. It can help you carry your water and supplies for a jaunt in the woods and it’s easy to store. But with the awkwardness of the Velcro seal and the odd scent, this bag can only be rated average overall.",1,"['like', 'short', 'hike', 'since', 'hike', 'usually', 'mile', 'prefer', 'backpack', 'fit', 'need', 'one', 'thing', 'lack', 'lighter', 'smaller', 'basic', 'backpack', 'need', 'add', 'bag', 'backpack', 'size', 'backpack', 'expected', 'make', 'smaller', 'backpack', 'still', 'large', 'enough', 'handle', 'need', 'hike', 'hour', 'doesn', 'ton', 'pocket', 'compartment', 'basic', 'work', 'well', 'basic', 'need', 'easily', 'lightweight', 'store', 'bag', 'size', 'test', 'short', 'hike', 'design', 'annoying', 'velcro', 'look', 'top', 'see', 'velcro', 'side', 'bag', 'use', 'way', 'make', 'touch', 'fold', 'roll', 'top', 'quite', 'made', 'something', 'wrong', 'work', 'barely', 'get', 'velcro', 'touch', 'even', 'good', 'bag', 'another', 'issue', 'bag', 'smell', 'type', 'smell', 'even', 'week', 'use', 'still', 'like', 'may', 'mind', 'like', 'hoping', 'maybe', 'time', 'medium', 'sized', 'backpack', 'bag', 'decent', 'option', 'help', 'carry', 'water', 'wood', 'easy', 'store', 'velcro', 'seal', 'bag', 'average', 'overall']"

3834,2.0,Eh Backpack with a Great Logo - Not Worth the Money,"When I saw this Gator backpack by Franklin I was excited to get it - but now that I’ve used it I am left underwhelmed.<br /><br />The logo is EXCELLENT.  The modern Albert head logo embroidered on a royal blue field circled in orange - affixed permanently to the heather grey shell outer fabric of the backpack does look great.<br /><br />Unfortunately that is about the extent of what I like about this backpack.<br /><br />The outer shell material is excessively stiff and the inner liner shell feels like cheap polyvinyl material that crinkles loudly anytime you move it.<br /><br />The overall design makes poor use of space and offers almost no built in organization methods, unlike most backpacks.<br /><br />The outer pocket, where typical backpacks have an area to hold things you need to access easily - writing utensils, keys, wallet, etc - this one opens to a large pocket that encompasses the entire front with only a small mesh divider that rises to the level of the zipper.  If you attempt to keep something there the first time the backpack is carried in any way but vertical everything in this pouch mixes within the larger front pocket.<br /><br />Each side has mesh places to hold water bottles or possibly an umbrella. Unfortunately these are made so small that while you can force a typical water bottle into it - it’s not easy.<br /><br />The main compartment has 1 divided area that is created with the crinkly material and elastic. It will hold a small laptop but the depth of this bag is so minimal that if that was in it there would be little room for anything else.<br /><br />While the ergonomically shaped straps have padding and meshed fabric for ventilation the back does not.<br /><br />The bottom of the bag has 2 zippers that open and reveal the ball hammock that extends from one pocket then buckle clips within the other with 2 plastic buckles.  I managed to use this to hold a beach towel once but for the most part I’ve found that feature a waste.<br /><br />At this price point there are vastly superior backpack options.  In regards to functionality, overall design and materials used this backpack is poor and I would not recommend it.<br /><br />I would advise finding another Gator backpack or attaching an embroidered Gator logo to a quality backpack.",1,"['saw', 'backpack', 'excited', 'get', 'used', 'left', 'logo', 'excellent', 'head', 'logo', 'blue', 'fabric', 'backpack', 'doe', 'look', 'great', 'unfortunately', 'like', 'backpack', 'material', 'stiff', 'feel', 'like', 'cheap', 'material', 'move', 'overall', 'design', 'make', 'poor', 'use', 'space', 'offer', 'almost', 'built', 'backpack', 'pocket', 'typical', 'backpack', 'area', 'hold', 'thing', 'need', 'easily', 'key', 'etc', 'one', 'open', 'large', 'pocket', 'entire', 'front', 'small', 'mesh', 'level', 'zipper', 'keep', 'something', 'first', 'time', 'backpack', 'way', 'everything', 'pouch', 'within', 'larger', 'front', 'pocket', 'side', 'mesh', 'place', 'hold', 'water', 'bottle', 'umbrella', 'unfortunately', 'made', 'small', 'typical', 'water', 'bottle', 'easy', 'main', 'compartment', 'area', 'material', 'elastic', 'hold', 'small', 'bag', 'little', 'room', 'anything', 'else', 'strap', 'padding', 'fabric', 'back', 'doe', 'bottom', 'bag', 'zipper', 'open', 'ball', 'one', 'pocket', 'clip', 'within', 'plastic', 'use', 'hold', 'beach', 'towel', 'part', 'found', 'feature', 'waste', 'price', 'point', 'backpack', 'option', 'overall', 'design', 'material', 'used', 'backpack', 'poor', 'recommend', 'another', 'backpack', 'logo', 'quality', 'backpack']"

3837,4.0,Its a good unit overall,"Its a good unit overall.  What I didn't like about it was that the bib tends to leak down your shirt, so you will look like a moron in a photo opp.  I think the tube should come out of the center if you want it to rather than one side or another.  The reason is because if you put it in a back pack and want to zipper it up around the tube, you don't leave the pocket half closed because the tube is on one side or the other.  Depends on how your pack zipper construction is.  Sometimes it will work as is, other times is wonky.  Its well constructed, but needs another few rounds of design review feedback.  I don't think the molle setup was good enough to attach to my day pack with only 4 attach points  You would really need to attach it through multiple loops for an external carry especially if you wanted to attach anything the back of the molle.  I ended up just puting it inside my pack, which makes the molle pretty useless and expensive.

3844,5.0,Best I have ever used. Has many other uses.,"I like how compact everything nicely fits into a very durable case. All of the accessories are quality made. I have used gun cleaning kits from many other manufacturers for cleaning engines and restoration cleaning of antiques. This one I can tell it will last it might be slower in ways compared to other methods yet it is gentle and really does an amazing job. Pulling the debris away from all of the areas that you do not want debris to be is critical for the life of everything from a firearm to an engine or anything else that requires the use of a cleaning kit like this. When you are finished using the kit clean everything up, put it away and you should have a tool kit that will last a long time. This is not a disposable or junk kit it is built to last just dont force it use common sense read instructions. I highly recommend this kit for anyone who is learning about firearms because it is simple to use. Used as the instructions say your not going to harm your investment you will protect it along with learning more about your firearms or whatever else you are cleaning. Give one of these a try you might like it. I know that I am very pleased with my purchase.

3856,2.0,NOT FOR HOT LIQUIDS; only keeps liquids cold; it is leakproof,"I am INCREDIBLY disappointed because I ordered this for hot liquids because the Amazon description says ""double-wall vacuum insulated to maintain cold or hot temperatures.""  However, once I received this and saw the plastic / rubberized tip and a similar type straw, I thought there is no way this is for hot liquid. I was right. After reading the attached card (see first photo), it says this is not for hot liquid. I have so many cold liquid containers that I did not want another one. This is also expensive and is not worth the purchase for just a cold beverage container when it was a hot liquid container that was wanted.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it works very well for cold liquids very well. This comes in three pieces (reservoir, top, straw). The straw gets screwed into the top. The tip is pliable and has to be sipped with strong suction. My water stayed cold all night long. I did put several ice cubes in the container with my tepid water and it felt like it came out of the fridge after about 12 hours.<br /><br />In addition to its thermal properties, it is also leakproof.<br /><br />In summary, this is four stars as a cold beverage insulating container but zero stars for hot simply because the straw and tip are not suitable for that.

I have another smaller pack with an elastic waistband I prefer for running. The neoprene like material used on the sides of the pack seems to be a very bad choice. If Nathan fixes this defect it would truly be a fantastic belt. I love how the top zipper entry makes the accessibility super nice! It makes pulling your phone in and out much easier(especially while riding) much better than on the front of the pack. There is a separate zipper compartment on the bottom which I use to carry my chapstick. Top zip pack rule! If the belt had a stretchy elastic belt that would also increase the desirability of this wait pack. Nathan fix this issue!

Outburst assisted opening is awesome, u feel tension and then bam blade is open and locked almost instantly. Really really well built design. Framelock works perfect and provides a big hunk of metal to lock the blade but is easily unlocked and does not stick. Just really impressed with this knife oh and it came super sharp.

I am returning this.,"Update... after charging approximately 3 times, now it won't turn on or do anything at all.<br /><br />I chose this one because it was more attractive than most of the others.  It does tell time, and measure heart rate and BP.  The touch screen doesn't work, or works intermittently.  I have to go to the app on my phone and tell it to take my blood pressure.  So, for $50, it might be an adequate, portable blood pressure monitor.  That is what I wanted it for, but I'm not really sure how accurate it is.  I like that you can customize the display.  Upload your own photo, decide what information you want it to show on the face.  The pedometer is not accurate; I can log up to 30 steps while I am sleeping!  But as a general measure of activity level, I suppose it is somewhat useful.  The sleep monitor is okay and makes a pretty graph on my phone... but I frequently get up during the night to use the bathroom, and then it stops recording, so I am not getting an accurate reading there either",1,"['update', 'charging', 'time', 'turn', 'anything', 'chose', 'one', 'others', 'doe', 'tell', 'time', 'heart', 'rate', 'touch', 'screen', 'doe', 'work', 'work', 'app', 'phone', 'tell', 'take', 'pressure', 'might', 'portable', 'pressure', 'monitor', 'wanted', 'really', 'sure', 'accurate', 'like', 'display', 'photo', 'information', 'want', 'show', 'face', 'accurate', 'step', 'sleeping', 'activity', 'level', 'somewhat', 'useful', 'sleep', 'monitor', 'okay', 'make', 'pretty', 'phone', 'get', 'night', 'use', 'stop', 'getting', 'accurate', 'reading', 'either']"

3893,2.0,"Useful Kit, Ruined by Bad Case","I selected this first aid kit to carry with me while backpacking. My thinking is that it is small and light and will have the basics down. I also knew that a full first aid kit would be better, but the asking price is low enough that it makes sense for many situations. The kit itself is fine, but like other reviews have stated the case in which the kit is stored is terrible.<br /><br />I won’t rehash the contents of the kit - that’s in the product description.<br /><br />The case is a side-latch case about the size of a deck of cards. The whole problem is the hinge. Mine came out of the package cracked and I can see a gap in the plastic where it should be closed around the pin, and it is a matter of time before it snaps completely and won’t close at all. My solution was to move everything to a small Lock-n-Lock which is actually waterproof and can take a lot more abuse. I will try to fix the original case with a glue gun and hope that it holds up better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this kit, even at the low asking price. The whole point of this kit is a small, compact and water resistant kit that can go anywhere. Instead, this is a kit with a fragile container that you’ll need to replace, and in that case it makes more sense to get a different kit anyway.",1,"['first', 'aid', 'kit', 'carry', 'backpacking', 'thinking', 'small', 'light', 'basic', 'also', 'full', 'first', 'aid', 'kit', 'better', 'price', 'low', 'enough', 'make', 'many', 'kit', 'fine', 'like', 'review', 'case', 'kit', 'terrible', 'won', 'kit', 'product', 'description', 'case', 'side', 'case', 'size', 'card', 'whole', 'problem', 'mine', 'came', 'package', 'see', 'plastic', 'closed', 'around', 'pin', 'matter', 'time', 'snap', 'completely', 'won', 'close', 'move', 'everything', 'small', 'lock', 'lock', 'actually', 'waterproof', 'take', 'lot', 'try', 'fix', 'original', 'case', 'gun', 'hope', 'hold', 'better', 'recommend', 'kit', 'even', 'low', 'price', 'whole', 'point', 'kit', 'small', 'compact', 'water', 'resistant', 'kit', 'anywhere', 'instead', 'kit', 'container', 'need', 'replace', 'case', 'make', 'get', 'different', 'kit', 'anyway']"

It has a carrying bag which makes it easy to store and take with you.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />I found that once it was at the right length, this was very easy to use.

RCBS wanted me to send but did not offer to pay... so back it went to Amazon for a speedy replacement. The new one was in an expected RCBS packaging. Threads are still a little rough... but finger threaded 3/4 way without problem then tightened up. This is the first RCBS product I have been disappointed with quality wise and disappointed that RCBS Customer service did not seem interested in helping me till I shipped a defective product back at my own expense.

3909,2.0,Sizing is incorrect,"Pros: Easy to blow up. I did so just by blowing air into the tube and it took me about 30 seconds to fill it with air. Material for the tube trainer is similar or the same as material that would be used for a swimsuit. The item does float, but I only tried it alone in a pool because my 4 year old could not fit the item. The inner tube seems to be made of what a normal pool float would be made of so I'm not sure of the durability, but I would compare it to that.<br /><br />Cons: Huge logo on the front is kind of an eye soar. The bottom loop is pretty uncomfortable, especially for boys. The biggest problem is the sizing. This item is advertised to fit kids ages 3-6, but the sizing guide says they are for kids 27-35 pounds and 34-40 inches tall. These measurements are not equivalent to kids 4+, unless they are smaller than the average sized kid. An average 4 year old is about 40 pounds and 40 inches tall so they would not be able to fit this item. I tried this on my four year old, who is tall for his age, so his height and weight are above average, but I was thinking since it said it goes up to the age of 6, it would fit him. The top part fit him just right and he weighs 42 pounds and is 45.5"" tall, but I don't see a kid any bigger than that being able to fit into the top half.

3977,2.0,COLOR BLEEDS; just barely works as foot bath; best for outdoors or repurpose as ice bucket,"I have another one of [[ASIN:B091GF5B46 these]] type foot baths and fell in love with it so much that I wanted another one.<br /><br />In the package is one carry pouch and one very small outdoor foot bath. The basin is fully collapsible and very small.  I unfolded it completely and made sure the edge of the basin was standing up.<br /><br />As can be seen by my photos, I actually used this indoors and it worked. I had to be careful not to let water flow over the edge. This is really for outdoor use only. To ensure the water stays inside, I only filled it several inches, enough to soak up to the base of my ankles.<br /><br />Once I was done, I rinsed the bath out. There was a water spot on my floor because the bottom of the basin gets wet when in the sink--another reason this should be used outdoors. Note that it takes many hours for this basin to dry. <br /><br />I was actually going to rate this 4 stars like I did my other one because it operates exactly the same.  However, the purple color of this bath bled all over my towels and I could not rinse the color out. It destroyed my towels.<br /><br />In summary, this foot bath is portable and does work as long as one is careful. However, this can be repurposed as an ice bucket with drinks for a picnic or to hold small beach toys for the kids. At the current price of $7.99, this is more expensive than the one I already own. It is not great but does somewhat serve the purpose it was intended for. What I love about this is that I do not have to carry a heavy pail to bathe my feet. Also, it folds down nicely. This would have received 4 stars from me if it were not for the color bleed. I cannot recommend this due to that issue and my recommendation would be to purchase this [[ASIN:B091GF5B46 one]] instead. Not only is that one cheaper but there is no color bleed.<br /><br />UPDATE: I washed the towels twice that this bucket bled on and the color DID NOT come out. This is such a BIG NEGATIVE. Even if using this outdoors, the color will bleed all over--one's clothes, the camper floor, the towels, etc.",1,"['another', 'one', 'asin', 'type', 'foot', 'fell', 'love', 'much', 'wanted', 'another', 'one', 'package', 'one', 'carry', 'pouch', 'one', 'small', 'foot', 'fully', 'small', 'completely', 'made', 'sure', 'edge', 'seen', 'photo', 'actually', 'used', 'worked', 'careful', 'let', 'water', 'edge', 'really', 'use', 'water', 'stay', 'inside', 'filled', 'several', 'inch', 'enough', 'base', 'ankle', 'done', 'water', 'spot', 'floor', 'bottom', 'get', 'wet', 'another', 'reason', 'used', 'note', 'take', 'many', 'hour', 'dry', 'actually', 'going', 'rate', 'star', 'like', 'one', 'exactly', 'however', 'color', 'towel', 'color', 'towel', 'foot', 'portable', 'doe', 'work', 'long', 'one', 'careful', 'however', 'ice', 'drink', 'hold', 'small', 'beach', 'toy', 'kid', 'current', 'price', 'expensive', 'one', 'already', 'great', 'doe', 'somewhat', 'purpose', 'intended', 'love', 'carry', 'heavy', 'foot', 'also', 'fold', 'nicely', 'received', 'star', 'color', 'recommend', 'due', 'issue', 'purchase', 'asin', 'one', 'instead', 'one', 'cheaper', 'color', 'update', 'washed', 'towel', 'color', 'come', 'big', 'even', 'using', 'color', 'one', 'floor', 'towel', 'etc']"

The length is where  you need to be sure you get the right/good fit- and this mat is 6 feet long. This may seem plenty big, especially for someone like me as, I’m 5’1”..!! However, keep in mind… Is the movement and stretches you’ll be doing while on your mat! And  for those much taller then, my 5ft self- this may pose a bit of a problem by not providing enough length..<br />•Best way to avoid getting a mat that is too short-<br />is to raise arms to a relaxed stance above head.. then, add that measurement to your total height- (from top if head to end of palms- add on these inches- not entire arms length!!) this will insure you’ll fit on your mat during all sun salutations and downward dogs! Makes sense.. But, something I hadn’t realized when ordering. Even so, @ 5ft. tall and reach of my arm still left me approx 4+” to spare- But, something to definitely be aware of when selecting!<br />•Strap is easy to put on and is all one piece-<br />Assemble in elastic material and has reinforced stitching to avoid breaking. **dont throw it away!! The strap was loose in bottom of box- and if you don’t look thoroughly, it could easily make it out to the trash- mine did!! But, once I realize it was missing I retraced my steps and found it on the bottom of the tubed boxed! Just pat attn.- this IS NOT placed on mat when it arrives!!! **Bonus: I LOVE the length of the strap.. not too long to bounce around your knees and get in the way when carried- This strap offers just enough slack to carry of the shoulder perfectly- I attached photos.. and this is perfect length!!! (length is NOT adjustable!)<br /><br />•Not all mats are created equal! BUT.. A thinner mat is not always a bad thing. I did order one with extra thickness before.. tbh, it’s very “grabby” on the feet.. This is thinner so, yes! You may feel pressure points on the floor a bit more however, this mat allows for easy movement with the feet- I loved the textured surface- it helps keeps feet from becoming sweaty and slipping!<br />• I have used the mat a handful of times.. and maybe OCD about disinfecting after every use, I don’t care! I use a misting mat cleaner that is all natural.. I spray both sides with a light coat. So far, we’ve held up just fine! No sticky or, peeling of the mat itself- **the key here people: to let cleaner dry before rolling/storing your mat!!! Here’s a Life hack: whenever you clean your mat, always be sure it’s 100% dry before rolling/storing! You will thank me for this and mats life expectancy will last much longer than you think! Not too mention, you won’t be the one who’s mat stinks up the room for the whole class.. that’s always a good thing!!<br />Overall, this is a great mat and good investment for any who need a clean, nice, decent space to do their exercises- it may not have all the added extras but, for many... those are just that, extra!<br />I can recommend this feeling confident it can do it’s job and one will get their moneys worth.<br />I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!",0,"['mat', 'nice', 'quality', 'price', 'great', 'beginner', 'sure', 'length', 'need', 'sure', 'get', 'right', 'good', 'fit', 'mat', 'foot', 'long', 'may', 'seem', 'plenty', 'big', 'especially', 'someone', 'like', 'however', 'keep', 'mind', 'stretch', 'mat', 'much', 'may', 'bit', 'problem', 'enough', 'length', 'best', 'way', 'getting', 'mat', 'short', 'arm', 'head', 'add', 'total', 'height', 'top', 'head', 'end', 'add', 'inch', 'entire', 'arm', 'length', 'fit', 'mat', 'sun', 'dog', 'make', 'something', 'even', 'tall', 'reach', 'arm', 'still', 'left', 'something', 'definitely', 'strap', 'easy', 'put', 'one', 'piece', 'assemble', 'elastic', 'material', 'stitching', 'do', 'nt', 'throw', 'away', 'strap', 'loose', 'bottom', 'box', 'look', 'easily', 'make', 'mine', 'missing', 'step', 'found', 'bottom', 'mat', 'love', 'length', 'strap', 'long', 'around', 'knee', 'get', 'way', 'strap', 'offer', 'enough', 'carry', 'shoulder', 'perfectly', 'attached', 'photo', 'perfect', 'length', 'length', 'adjustable', 'mat', 'mat', 'always', 'bad', 'thing', 'order', 'one', 'extra', 'thickness', 'foot', 'yes', 'may', 'feel', 'pressure', 'point', 'floor', 'bit', 'however', 'mat', 'allows', 'easy', 'foot', 'loved', 'surface', 'help', 'keep', 'foot', 'used', 'mat', 'time', 'maybe', 'every', 'use', 'care', 'use', 'mat', 'side', 'light', 'far', 'held', 'fine', 'mat', 'key', 'people', 'let', 'dry', 'mat', 'life', 'clean', 'mat', 'always', 'sure', 'dry', 'thank', 'mat', 'life', 'last', 'much', 'longer', 'think', 'won', 'one', 'mat', 'room', 'whole', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'overall', 'great', 'mat', 'good', 'need', 'clean', 'nice', 'decent', 'space', 'exercise', 'may', 'added', 'extra', 'many', 'extra', 'recommend', 'feeling', 'job', 'one', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'hope', 'info', 'help', 'feel', 'free', 'let', 'know']"

4013,3.0,Knife-like edge is USELESS but spoon & fork are usable,"I ordered their [[ASIN:B07M8K5VQ8 Titanium spork]] and decided to order this pair as well since it was cheaper and I needed an extra one for my boyfriend when I do day trips.<br /><br />This is a thick plastic spork that is just somewhat stronger than a typical plastic utensil. It is BPA-free and is food and dishwasher safe. There is a fork on one end with one of the tines that has a ""knife-like"" edge. There is a spoon on the other end. The center holes can be used to fasten this to a backpack using the reusable teather it comes packaged with.<br /><br />I got this because many times when I go on a staycation, I pack a cooler with yogurt and stuff for day travel. This is perfect for that. I ate with the spoon and fork fine but I could not cut anything of substance with the knife. I think $4.99 is reasonable for what this is but the knife-like edge is completely useless. A butter knife cuts better. However, the spoon and fork are good for any ""away-type"" eating such as camping, backpacking, or just a staycation with a cooler in tow.<br /><br />Even though the price is right, the reason I give this 3 stars is because the knife is useless and the thick plastic has a different mouth feel and pick-up ability. For instance, when I was eating yogurt with the spoon, I could not scrape the container as easily with the spoon end as I could with the [[ASIN:B07M8K5VQ8 Titanium Spork]].

4016,4.0,Perfect device to help you with doing the splits...,"THE GOOD:<br />---------------<br />* This is a nice equipment to have if you'd like to improve your splits for yoga, gymnastics, kung-fu, etc.<br />* The seat included seems high quality and comfortable.<br />* The bars/struts are made of metal.<br />* No instructions on how to use it, but watch their demo video, and the unit is pretty intuitive. Just crank the device clockwise to start stretching!<br />* Customer service was good. I had an issue and they were willing to send me a replacement, but I figure my solution was better. Read below.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* You adjust the struts by pulling up a knob, so you can drop the pin on the next hole. These knobs are made of plastic and, apparently, not high quality. Because out the box, one of our knobs was broken. Without this knob, you cannot pull up the pin. And in reading another review, seems like broken knobs is common thing. But if you have eye hooks laying around, you can make something better. I simply drilled a pilot hole on top of the broken stem. Then by hand, I screwed in an eye hook. This eye hook is never going to break or come lose. My first solution was glue, it didn't last long. Screwing in an eye hook is the way to go! Look at my pictures.<br />* The stretchers and the seat are separate components. So putting it away takes a little more management, since it's not an all in one device.<br />* The included bags that came with it feel like an after thought, and weren't really designed for the components. It would have been great if a bigger, higher quality bag was included so that you can house everything together.<br /><br />Because of QC issues, I rate this product 4-Stars.

4028,5.0,Sticks to the Basics and Gets Them Right,"I have a pocket knife in my pocket at all times and I have found having one on me is almost always useful. I had not heard of Old Timer until recently, but their knives look nice and I thought I would give them a chance. So far I am very pleased with this particular knife.<br /><br />This is a no-frills knife that doesn't try to get too fancy. The blades have to be pulled open manually without a spring assist, and it does not have some of the things that other knives frequently have such as a corkscrew, screwdriver and other integrated emergency tools. Instead it has three blades - nothing more. Each blade is different and has different uses, though the thought that comes to mind when I look at the knife as a whole is whittling and carving.<br /><br />The blades are tight and do not wobble. That's a good thing and says that the knife as a whole is assembled well. The blades feel solid and secure when opened.<br /><br />I love the bone handle. It feels good in the hand and it looks retro which is a good thing. The texture makes it easy to maintain a grip, even when hands are just a little wet.<br /><br />This is a smallish knife, so it will fit in your pocket and not take up lots of room. This is a little smaller than most knives I am used to carrying, and that's a mixed bag to me - on one hand I like having a larger knife, probably because I am used to having one, but on the other I like the fact that it is small, compact and lightweight.<br /><br />This is a very nice knife that sticks to getting the basics right without a bunch of extras that only add weight and take away from the overall package.

The 60 felt way more natural/comfortable for long days, and the top portion wasn’t against and over the back of my head like the 70 was. It felt like all of the extra space on the 70 was all behind my head. If you don’t absolutely need the extra space, I’d quickly recommend the 60 as a more manageable size.<br />One other thing to note is that at 5’7”, I was near the end of the upper/useable range for the torso adjustment. I had to move it as far as I could to get the hip belt to sit in the correct position.

The instructions are off in the sense that somethings came assembled that the instructions said were not and at least 1 part is labeled differently in the instructions than in the here's what's in the box.<br /><br />Noise: I have it sitting on a towel and it's very quiet to me.<br /><br />Usability: there is one minor flaw, to raise or lowered the seat you have to get on the ground to see in the little to line up the holes to put the pin in to steady the seat. A flash lighted made it easier but if yiy ha e multiple people using it would be a pain to have to move.<br />* major flaw to me- the instrument box. The speedometer is way off. I can't tell if it's on mph or kph but I suspect it's just making stuff up. I know my lazy I haven't ridden a bike in 30 years butt is not going 11mph/19kph after pedaling maybe 5 rotations. I also know i do not ride a mile in 4 mins. The calorie count is crazy too. Like the number goes up by 1 every second and I know it's not that easy to burn a calorie!! I'll need to find some other way to try and track that.<br /><br />Storage- take out a pin, push together and it stands upright (have to put pin back in to make it stay). Good feature. Still takes up some space and i foresee many years of toe stubbing in my future.<br /><br />I am a little irked by the display not working righ.

The boot and heel strap are amazingly comfortable and strong, but the composite fin is too long and whippy for training in either a pool or open water. I would not even want to do kick sets with these.  I personally would not even want to use these for snorkeling because I would always be waiting for the tips of my fins to catch up to what I was trying to do in the water to position myself for snorkeling/sightseeing.<br /><br />The disappointment next. The U.S. Swim Divers Large Fitness Fins had an open heel which I generally prefer because I wear different booties during the 12 months of the year. The length of the boot was perfect, the heel strap was strong, easily adjusted, and comfortable, and the boots felt really comfortable in shape and foot support EXCEPT for the constant pressure on the knuckle of the little toe on each foot.  I'm absolutely a typical size 11, but they hurt my foot, and if you have a slightly thicker or wider size 10.5--11 foot go up to the XL.  I personally didn't order the next size up because while I was kicking with them I could really feel that this fin was not stiff enough for training, and certainly not for kick sets. The rubber fin was bending too easily on every kick at the seam just beyond my toes on both fins - IMOP a serious design flaw for a &#34;fitness fin.&#34; I could never do kick sets in these, but I could use these for snorkeling since the tips of the fins do spring back almost quickly enough to be responsive to my changes in direction and speed.<br /><br />SO COMFORTABLE BUT SO LONG. The black and yellow Cressi Palau Short Snorkeling Fins size LG--XLG had a great shaped boot, a strong and flexible heel strap, and they were absolutely the MOST comfortable boot of all those I tried, BUT these were definitely a better snorkeling fin and/or an open-water training fin. They were absolutely strong enough for open water training (which I rarely get to do anymore), but too way too long for endurance training in a pool with a harness. If these were 2 inches shorter they would have been my overall pick of a stiff training fin.<br /><br />I liked the way the SEAC Black Fins looked, but had to go up to the X-Large (11-12.5) and they were perfect.  They have the fixed heal strap which I usually don't prefer, but this one is strong and stretchy enough to be very comfortable.  The open heel did not make my feet feel unsupported at all. With barefeet they were a little soft, but with a 2mm or 5mm neoprene bootie they fit my feet perfectly. The front of the boot is comfortable lengthwise and widthwise, and there's no unnecessary gimmics in the fin design. As the ad says these are ideal for open water snorkeling for a good swimmer, and ideal for pool training. The fin is short enough and stiff enough for what I wanted to do. I can do flutter kicks or slow subtle kicks just to keep my feet afloat when I am working on my upper body.  The fins do not add any extra buoyancy which I don't need with easy kicking or with a wetsuit on six months of the year. I am so glad I loved these.<br /><br />I just had to try something new with the TYR BP Burner Fins LG (size 11 -- Red & Black).  They had to be exchanged for the XL - the Blue and Black, and I feared they might be too big, but I found they have a very stretchy and supportive heel pocket, that was as comfortable and supportive as the adjustable heel straps I usually prefer. The TYR EP Burners boot will be my spring and summer fins as they fit my naked foot or with a 2mm bootie perfectly.  It's good that the fin is just that short because just another inch or so and the fin would be too flexible.  Perfect design by TYR for a training fin. As the ad says &#34;The perfect fins for training at race cadence.&#34; I kept these for warmer water training and the SEAC's for cold water training.  I would also use each of these for snorkeling, as I am a strong swimmer and I want my fins to be very responsive to the demand I am putting on them to change direction or to accelerate and change speed.<br /><br />I was not asked to give this review or compensated by anyone.

4116,4.0,Great If You Can Not Do Conventional Push Ups Due To Wrist Issues,"When it comes to push ups, I have had a struggle with them for years due to wrist issues.  The strain is too much and I can not do them.  These handles, however, help.  Let's see how.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These are thick black PVC sort of pipe.  They come in pieces and you put them together.  You will have to lean heavily on them on the floor to get them to snap into place.  There is an orange cushioned handle that you grab.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PERFORM?<br />I have to say that these are pretty sturdy but I used them on a rug.  I have not used them on a slick floor.  They stayed in place well and seemed to hold the weight well too.  I would say that these are probably more for people under 300 pounds or perhaps less than that.<br /><br />STORAGE<br />These don't take up much room and are so lightweight that they can easily be stored under a couch or out of sight.  I like to grab them and do a few pushups now and then.  I noticed my kids have been doing the same.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a quick way to do pushups that does not strain the wrist the same way, these can be held in either direction and used to help the arms get exercise without hurting the wrists so much.  They seem to support the weight well and are lightweight and easy to store.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  The cushion could be just a bit larger for my hands.  It is still a bit slim to get a good grip that does not hurt the wrists at all.  But that is just a small thing.

The last small screws that went in were the hardest and took a lot of elbow grease. Some of the very top horizontal curved bars face more inward than others so it was hard to tell which way they went. Could use a label since you can't tell until you have them up if they are the right direction. Overall I liked almost  everything about this, except the last part of tying the elastic straps on. There are A LOT of them and wasn't sure if I should be double knotting or single knotting them. Wish there was a better way to secure it than individually knotting all the straps. I was able to do almost all of the assembly by myself, but used some help when putting on the net. But I think one person could do it all just fine. Took about an hour and half to assemble. This is a good size if you have a small yard. Both granddaughters fit on it just fine even though it says one person only. It has good bounce to it as well.

The kama blade is also set in the handle, not on top of the handle, and the blade is single-pegged, with a flimsy-looking method, not traditionally double pegged, and it does NOT have a tang that extends down into the handle as the picture would suggest, since the blade is attached to the handle in an entirely different manner than depicted....<br /><br />Although the materials seem sturdy, the construction does not seem to make it suitable for real use.<br /><br />Buy this only if you want an unsharpened practice kama.

Almost two inches of the tip of one kama was sticking out and some of the paper was torn.

4141,3.0,Great expandable weights,"Bought these to add to my gym.  After reading a ton of reviews about the bowflex version of these, I decided on  buying the powerblock.

I can do over head extensions, bench press, curls and many more exercises without any limitations for there size.  I have been the gym for 6 years now and decided to make my own gym at home.

Not only is the lead too bulky and slick to *safely* hold on to (seriously, it's dangerous-- it'll slip through your hands and cause severe burns), but the darn halter is too slippery to stay even tied! I know how to tie a rope halter correctly (knot goes on the bottom/back, not top/front) and there's no WAY that should slip, never in my life had another halter slip like that even with a big ornery horse tied solid-- yet this joke of a halter I had to tighten up every few steps while leading a yearling pony!

I hate this thing, viscerally, from deep down in my being I loathe it, with every fiber.<br /><br />This halter/lead is literally dangerous and an accident waiting to happen on several levels, and it shouldn't be on the market.

Other reviews mentioned how helpful it is to be able to change hand positioning to increase/reduce tension, but - for me - the webbing is neither comfortable to fit my hand into nor to hold on to. And it's made from the kind of material that picks up *every* bit of debris. My son dropped it on the floor, and now I'm trying to pull and wash pet hair off this band. Not fun.

4197,5.0,Good Mat Design,"I got this mainly for my wife, but I also do the p90x Yoga routine and know the value of a good mat. I liked this mat design better than the typical rolls you see people carrying around. Those rolls tend to curl up at the ends which gets pretty annoying and is a distraction from what you're trying to achieve. This mat lays absolutely flat and is easy to clean (hand wash, don't put it in the washing machine).<br /><br />The surface has a good grip and you feel very stable whether you use it with bare feet or socks. It's not as thick as a typical mat, but it is very large and you can fold it up on itself if you need extra padding. The product measures 70 inches by 24 inches and comes in an attractive box that makes this an ideal gift.<br /><br />The fabric is thick enough not to tear and provides a little bit of cushion although this really can't be called a pad. Still, I liked the portability and non-slip features of this mat. Also, it's small enough to fit in a backpack, so you don't have to carry around a huge rolled up tube.

4198,3.0,"Very lightweight, chips easily, dirt cheap, HUGE","Bought for a multipurpose camping mug, because I wanted something big enough for anything, and very light and cheap enough that if it gets damaged or lost I won't care. Got a set of two on sale along with two of the matching 6"" bowls for under $10 for all four pieces. Yes, really. Could not be happier, even though one of the mugs has a chip on the far side of the lip (not the side I would use for drinking). The chipped one is backup.<br /><br />This is cheap stuff folks - do not expect it not to chip if you drop it on a hard surface, but it will not break. The equivalent of the Coleman mug in every way (in fact, it might be the exact same mug, private labeled...). Again, don't overthink this: it's seriously inexpensive (the smaller 12oz Coleman one goes on sale often, btw).<br /><br />FYI, this mug is HUGE. It will hold 24oz - that's the contents of TWO cans of coke/beer/etc. I've included a photo to give you a sense of scale. You know how some people (me) keep pens in coffee mugs? Well, this mug is too big for that. The pen in the mug in the photo is a normal Pilot G2 07. The mug would hold easily 150 of them.

4212,5.0,A Well Made Product - I Love It!,"In thinking about how to review a water bottle, I figure there are three important questions about one. Does it leak? Is it durable? Is it easy to carry around? The appearance of the bottle can be an extra bonus if it is noticeably nice looking. This Takeya water bottle scores excellent on all counts including the appearance bonus. Testing for leakage was easy. I simply filled the bottle and left it  lying top down on a steep incline with a dry t shirt underneath it. After three hours, not a drop had leaked out. Regarding durability, only time will tell for sure but the bottle feels sturdy and well made.  As for portability. the bottle is slender enough to fit most cup holders and there is a nice sized handle attached to the lid for easy carrying. The bottle is a cobalt blue that I find to be quite beautiful but that may be a matter of personal taste as I've always liked that color.<br /><br />There is one other thing of note. Before the Takeya bottle arrived, I thought its claim to having the ""best lid ever"" sounded a bit overblown. After all, a lid is a lid isn't it? Well, as soon as the bottle arrived and I took my first drink out of it, I realized that this was a particularly good lid for me. I tend to be clumsy and fumble fingered enough that I drop bottle caps and lids on a fairly regular basis. This lid has two parts, a larger one for filling the bottle easily and then a smaller cap to unscrew when taking a drink. That smaller cap is attached to the larger lid which means I'll never have to worry about dropping it. That's just a sweet little extra for me but one that I really, really like. All in all, I think this is an excellent product. It's about as well made and attractive as a water bottle can be until they manufacture one that can go in the kitchen to refill itself.  :)",0,"['thinking', 'review', 'water', 'bottle', 'figure', 'three', 'important', 'one', 'doe', 'leak', 'durable', 'easy', 'carry', 'around', 'bottle', 'extra', 'nice', 'looking', 'water', 'bottle', 'excellent', 'including', 'easy', 'simply', 'filled', 'bottle', 'left', 'top', 'dry', 'shirt', 'underneath', 'three', 'hour', 'drop', 'durability', 'time', 'tell', 'sure', 'bottle', 'feel', 'sturdy', 'well', 'made', 'bottle', 'enough', 'fit', 'cup', 'holder', 'nice', 'sized', 'handle', 'attached', 'lid', 'easy', 'carrying', 'bottle', 'blue', 'find', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'may', 'matter', 'taste', 'always', 'liked', 'color', 'one', 'thing', 'note', 'bottle', 'arrived', 'thought', 'best', 'lid', 'ever', 'bit', 'lid', 'lid', 'well', 'soon', 'bottle', 'arrived', 'took', 'first', 'drink', 'good', 'lid', 'enough', 'drop', 'bottle', 'cap', 'lid', 'fairly', 'regular', 'lid', 'two', 'part', 'larger', 'one', 'bottle', 'easily', 'smaller', 'cap', 'taking', 'drink', 'smaller', 'cap', 'attached', 'larger', 'lid', 'mean', 'never', 'worry', 'little', 'extra', 'one', 'really', 'really', 'like', 'think', 'excellent', 'product', 'well', 'made', 'water', 'bottle', 'one']"

This is a great set that is user friendly, decently priced, easy to store and travel with (once that is possible again!) And let me tell you- it offers plenty of intense exercise that all can be done with an exercise band. Ohh, and this does so with each level kicking the intensity up a notch. Ulala.<br /><br />These bands are made of a durable quality and provide BOTH, the stretch and resistance- without both, you won’t get what’s truly needed. These are a perfect in width and have been ergonomically designed so, they won’t roll down when in use. Trust me on this one.. I had a diff. set in a “pretty pastel“ of the same style band- only wider and had big issues with those rolling. These are cut thinner and also, have a smooth finish so no pulling the skin- a total added perk!<br /><br /> This uses a “step up“ level that is conducive to this type of workout equipment. These have plenty of defined levels- clearly marked from easy to extreme! And you will definitely see (feel!!) the diff. in between levels- TBH, I’m getting a solid workout at level 3... I can barely pull off- 3 sets/10 reps with the 4th- So much so, I haven’t even attempted band 5! But, this is a good thing! As my workout and strengthening continues, I’ll have the next level waiting to keeping improving my workout!!<br /><br />These bands are clearly marked and as mentioned, they step up level of intensity with each colored band- I appreciate the ability to use different bands for different muscles/exercises. Hack: look online- you can easily find videos and step-by-step examples or, instruction for varied exercise options.<br />I realize these are photographed being used on butt, hip, thighs.. however, you can find plenty of options for varied muscle groups.<br />**Hack: To clean, I use a- yoga mat antibacterial spray or, a wet wipe to clean off.

I purchased a storm C2 glove at first, when I got the glove the mechanism was complicated to me. Also, the bracket that held the strap that goes around your wrist; that clamp was loose and everytime you released the strap, the clamp would fall. Calling and speaking with the seller was not helpful in minimizing the concerns of losing the clamp or making all the gadgets less complicated. I asked him if all of the devices came with an unattached clamp, and he assured me that they all come that way now. I have been using a pro release glove for many years. Well I  returned the storm. I went ahead and purchased the Brunswick bionic from a different seller on Amazon, bowl.com. the glove is not anything like the storm c2. The clamp is secure to the strap and very easy to put on and take off. The mechanism is uncomplicated to work and the adjustment works well to release the action on the ball.

I usually just add to the cooking process and its good to go.<br /><br />Food scarcity is legit, so if you can stock up when items are on sale, then I recommend to do so. Consider it insurance.<br /><br />FYI: food and such are sold based on weight, not volume. There is 1lb, 2 oz packed in this #10 can (that reads, ""number ten"" not ""ten pound""- it is a size of can). Using a #10 can means that it provides uniformity among storage. Emergency supplies are packed for long term and are packed to stack. They also float. They can be repurposed.

4240,5.0,Glad I went with this Machine Rower,"I retired this summer from a full time desk job, and at least 100 pounds more than I want to be. Wanting to start a fitness program, now that I did not have a 10 hour day, I remembered that I really enjoyed my rower machine in the 1990's.  I did not want to spend quite as much as I did, however the reviews on the cheaper ones just were not as stellar as I would have liked.  I spent several days reading and researching what was available and decided that this unit using my own weight, legs, arms to maneuver this to an incline was smarter than a unit with a pump or cable.  It was easy to assemble ( I am a 62 yr old female ) and absolutely hysterical to try to get started on.  Once I adjusted the tension knob for the rowing arms and readjusted the foot pedals I was good to go.  Now, I have two bad knees, and a torn Achilles tendon, riddled with arthritis and fibromyalgia - I weigh 284 lbs at 5'9"".  I had to figure out a way to get ON the seat since the device is on the floor and I can't do that (yet) but here it is - I love this machine - I do my stretches first, I have music set for a 45 minute workout - so far day three on the machine I have gotten about 7 minutes in with the full machine and another 10 minutes just using the pedals and seat to work muscles and get the cardio that I am supposed to.  My knees hurt LESS and I can already get up my cellar stairs with less pain.  It works my core too, and then of course the arms.  Since I don't want to get injured I am going slow but the machine itself was worth every penny.  I can move it around at will and store it upright.  It fits right in my art studio so it is not in the way in the rest of the house.  And the seat is wonderfully comfortable to sit on.  I can even stand up from the seated position on my own already.  Very pleased, I hope it lasts a while, I did keep all papers and tools in case.

4268,5.0,I'm astounded at how I love this fitness hoop,"Based on the other reviews, I expected to be extremely disappointed in this Altus Fitness Hoop.  However, I absolutely adore this product because assembly is easy (see ASSEMBLY CAUTION note below) and since the hoop is weighted it is easy to keep going while doing the regular ""hula hoop"" motion.  The hoop also has an all foam exterior so it cushions the impact on your mid-section.<br /><br />I was able to do the traditional core excercise for 20 minutes straight without a problem.  The only issue I had was that my mid-section felt sore because of the constant weight that was rotating around my stomach and waist. (The instructions warn of this for first time users.)<br /><br />The hoop is a bit large and you have to use all the alternating color segments when assembling, so you can't make it smaller.  It is about about 2-3 inches larger in circumference than my regular adult hula hoop which fit snugly inside the circumference of this hoop.  As a result, I had to use this in the parking lot of my condo complex because I had no room in the house.  This resulted in some spectators, of course.<br /><br />Besides doing my core exercise in public, I also tried to do the arm exercises with the hoop.  However, due to the weight I was unable to; but then again I never used a hula hoop any other way other than on my hips and that is all I wanted this for.<br /><br />Other than the soreness I felt due to the rotating weight, this hoop is lots of fun.  I can't vouch for the claim that it will imporve core strength and trim your waist, but I suppose that it might if you do it longer enough over a couple of months. When I hula my movement is very subtle so I doubt I'm burning more than a few calories.  However, if you really gyrate when you hula, then you'll get more of a workout with this device.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY CAUTION:  The assembly instructions that came with this product are extremely poor. The way to assemble this hoop so that it does not come apart is to insert each segment into the previous segment and make sure that the ""segment's release button"" for each segment on your RIGHT is slightly protruding under the foam where the button connector dots are located for each segment on the LEFT. To test, twist (in an up and down motion) the left and right segments you just connected and also try to pull the segments in the opposite direction.  If neither segment twists or pulls apart, then they are securely connected.  Repeat this procedure for each segment of the hoop.  Not once did this hoop fall apart on me. However, had I not done the twist and pull test, it would have fallen apart repeatedly because it takes some finagling to get each segment in place securely. Although this hoop is easy to assemble it still took me about 10-15 minutes to assemble the entire hoop since I made about 4 attempts and 4 tests per left and right segment to get the segments securely connected so they wouldn't fall off no matter how hard I pulled or twisted.<br /><br />May 14 Update:  I've been using this hoop every day except one for over a week now and still love it.  It has not come apart once.  Due to the weight of the hoop hitting against my body on rotation, I did develop a one inch bruise on my right hip. Other than this brusie I don't have any negative effects and the soreness I experienced when I used it the first time has gone away completely.  I absolutely love this fitness hula hoop.  Although I don't think I'm losing any weight from this, I find it a lot of fun and it's worth it just for that.

4269,3.0,"Decent for a hard bottom boat, but heavy and difficult to assemble","This seems like a pretty decent raft with real seats and a hard bottom. I've owned and used an Intex Excursion 5, so I'm comparing it to that inflatable boat. The Intex is rated to seat 5 people but it's not much more than air pillows on an inflatable mattress. This Anythingsports model seats only 4 officially, but feels solid, you can stand, move around, and sit with your feet under you like a proper raft. It has a hard back for a motor mount, but I found the oars actually very easy to use to maneuver (much better than the Intex).<br />However due to the hard floor and the rear back, it's actually SIGNIFICANTLY heavier and harder to build. The instructions are also pretty terrible and difficult to understand. Carrying it requires at least two people in my experience so far, and inflating it with the included pump is a joke. It uses Halkey-Roberts valves for the air in multiple locations (3 sides and one bottom), which means none of my regular electric pumps worked. When using their foot pump, it was really difficult to make it all the way inflated, so we took it out with visible wrinkles still in the siding. It help up alright, but I managed to find an electric pump on Amazon with the correct Halkey-Roberts valve and was able to fill it all the way much more easily (see pictures).<br />It comes with an included carrying bag, but it's sort of a big flat shape of material with straps to tie at the top- not as much as bag as a way to just tie everything together. Things constantly shifted while carrying it and the bag started to rip in some places already. Honestly, for around a thousand dollars that they are asking, it feels like they could have given you much better bag or at least thrown in an electric pump. The experience would be so much better if they had.<br />Compared to our Intex 5 seater, the Intex is missing much of what makes this great- there's no hard bottom, motor mount is an extra accessory, it's more difficult to row, etc... BUT, it's easy to carry and assemble solo, and it costs only about 200 dollars.  For 5 times more, you get a much easier and more comfortable raft, but much more difficult to build and carry, and you need a special electric motor if you don't already have one of these valves (it is the same kind found on many paddle boards).<br />Feels like the price tag is little high for what you get, but I see other similar boats cost more so maybe this is considered a good value for a hard bottom.",1,"['seems', 'like', 'pretty', 'decent', 'real', 'seat', 'hard', 'bottom', 'used', 'seat', 'people', 'much', 'air', 'pillow', 'mattress', 'model', 'seat', 'feel', 'solid', 'stand', 'move', 'around', 'sit', 'foot', 'like', 'hard', 'back', 'mount', 'found', 'actually', 'easy', 'use', 'much', 'better', 'however', 'due', 'hard', 'floor', 'rear', 'back', 'actually', 'heavier', 'build', 'instruction', 'also', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'difficult', 'understand', 'carrying', 'requires', 'least', 'two', 'people', 'experience', 'far', 'included', 'pump', 'valve', 'air', 'multiple', 'side', 'one', 'bottom', 'mean', 'regular', 'pump', 'worked', 'using', 'foot', 'pump', 'really', 'difficult', 'make', 'way', 'inflated', 'took', 'still', 'help', 'find', 'pump', 'amazon', 'correct', 'valve', 'able', 'fill', 'way', 'much', 'easily', 'see', 'picture', 'come', 'included', 'carrying', 'bag', 'sort', 'big', 'flat', 'shape', 'material', 'strap', 'tie', 'top', 'much', 'bag', 'way', 'tie', 'everything', 'together', 'thing', 'carrying', 'bag', 'started', 'place', 'already', 'honestly', 'around', 'feel', 'like', 'given', 'much', 'better', 'bag', 'least', 'pump', 'experience', 'much', 'better', 'compared', 'missing', 'much', 'make', 'great', 'hard', 'bottom', 'mount', 'extra', 'difficult', 'etc', 'easy', 'carry', 'assemble', 'cost', 'time', 'get', 'much', 'easier', 'comfortable', 'much', 'difficult', 'build', 'carry', 'need', 'already', 'one', 'valve', 'kind', 'found', 'many', 'paddle', 'board', 'feel', 'like', 'price', 'little', 'high', 'get', 'see', 'similar', 'cost', 'maybe', 'good', 'value', 'hard', 'bottom']"

4271,3.0,Too flexible at the joint in the rubber at the end of your toes for a training fin.  Better for snorkeling.,"I really wanted to like these US Swim Divers Fitness Fins. I needed a size 11 short fin for long distance endurance swimming in a harness in my pool year-round. I did not need a fin that was too buoyant and would make me lazy in my kicking.<br /><br />I compared the yellow and black Phantom Aquatics Speed Sport Adjustable Snorkeling Fins L/XL (size 9-13); the US Swim Divers Grey and Black Large Fitness Fins; the black and yellow Cressi Palau Short Snorkeling Fins size LG--XLG; the SEAC Black (Large 9.5 --11) Fins with the fixed heal strap and open heel; and the TYR BP Burner Fins LG (size 11 -- Blue & Black).<br /><br />First off I had to send back the large SEAC's and large TYR EP Burner's to get the XL size. Both of them were painfully tight on my size 11 feet.<br /><br />The worst first. The yellow and black Phantom Aquatics Speed Sport Adjustable Snorkeling Fins L/XL (size 9-13) are for snorkeling and not for training of any kind. The boot and heel strap are amazingly comfortable and strong, but the composite fin is too long and whippy for training in either a pool or open water. I would not even want to do kick sets with these.  I personally would not even want to use these for snorkeling because I would always be waiting for the tips of my fins to catch up to what I was trying to do in the water to position myself for snorkeling/sightseeing.<br /><br />The disappointment next. The U.S. Swim Divers Large Fitness Fins had an open heel which I generally prefer because I wear different booties during the 12 months of the year. The length of the boot was perfect, the heel strap was strong, easily adjusted, and comfortable, and the boots felt really comfortable in shape and foot support EXCEPT for the constant pressure on the knuckle of the little toe on each foot.  I'm absolutely a typical size 11, but they hurt my foot, and if you have a slightly thicker or wider size 10.5--11 foot go up to the XL.  I personally didn't order the next size up because while I was kicking with them I could really feel that this fin was not stiff enough for training, and certainly not for kick sets. The rubber fin was bending too easily on every kick at the seam just beyond my toes on both fins - IMOP a serious design flaw for a &#34;fitness fin.&#34; I could never do kick sets in these, but I could use these for snorkeling since the tips of the fins do spring back almost quickly enough to be responsive to my changes in direction and speed.<br /><br />SO COMFORTABLE BUT SO LONG. The black and yellow Cressi Palau Short Snorkeling Fins size LG--XLG had a great shaped boot, a strong and flexible heel strap, and they were absolutely the MOST comfortable boot of all those I tried, BUT these were definitely a better snorkeling fin and/or an open-water training fin. They were absolutely strong enough for open water training (which I rarely get to do anymore), but too way too long for endurance training in a pool with a harness. If these were 2 inches shorter they would have been my overall pick of a stiff training fin.<br /><br />I liked the way the SEAC Black Fins looked, but had to go up to the X-Large (11-12.5) and they were perfect.  They have the fixed heal strap which I usually don't prefer, but this one is strong and stretchy enough to be very comfortable.  The open heel did not make my feet feel unsupported at all. With barefeet they were a little soft, but with a 2mm or 5mm neoprene bootie they fit my feet perfectly. The front of the boot is comfortable lengthwise and widthwise, and there's no unnecessary gimmics in the fin design. As the ad says these are ideal for open water snorkeling for a good swimmer, and ideal for pool training. The fin is short enough and stiff enough for what I wanted to do. I can do flutter kicks or slow subtle kicks just to keep my feet afloat when I am working on my upper body.  The fins do not add any extra buoyancy which I don't need with easy kicking or with a wetsuit on six months of the year. I am so glad I loved these.<br /><br />I just had to try something new with the TYR BP Burner Fins LG (size 11 -- Red & Black).  They had to be exchanged for the XL - the Blue and Black, and I feared they might be too big, but I found they have a very stretchy and supportive heel pocket, that was as comfortable and supportive as the adjustable heel straps I usually prefer. The TYR EP Burners boot will be my spring and summer fins as they fit my naked foot or with a 2mm bootie perfectly.  It's good that the fin is just that short because just another inch or so and the fin would be too flexible.  Perfect design by TYR for a training fin. As the ad says &#34;The perfect fins for training at race cadence.&#34; I kept these for warmer water training and the SEAC's for cold water training.  I would use each of these for snorkeling, as I am a strong swimmer and I want my fins to be very responsive to the demand I am putting on them to change direction or to accelerate and change speed.<br /><br />I was not asked to give this review or compensated by anyone.

That in combination with the forward flashlight mounted on the handlebar gives me enough visibility as I move forward and also for cars that are passing me and making any right turns or veering  into my lane.<br /><br />Very happy with this product.,0,"['easy', 'put', 'bought', 'two', 'blue', 'one', 'attached', 'front', 'wheel', 'pretty', 'red', 'light', 'back', 'ride', 'mostly', 'important', 'sun', 'going', 'putting', 'two', 'blue', 'one', 'front', 'wheel', 'help', 'turn', 'without', 'turn', 'getting', 'dark', 'two', 'also', 'light', 'underneath', 'bike', 'forward', 'flashlight', 'handlebar', 'give', 'enough', 'move', 'forward', 'also', 'car', 'making', 'right', 'turn', 'happy', 'product']"
4298,3.0,No instructions and cheap quality but still functional resistance bands,"I expected more from this resistance band set but for the current price of $17.99 it is just okay. First, this set comes with absolutely no instructions other than what I found on the Amazon site. Second, one of the clips on the resistant band barely opens and when it does it sticks. Third, the foam on the handles does not extend the full length of the handle. Forth, the internal roll on the door anchor easily slips off.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the lack of instructions. Nevertheless, I tried each one of these cables. The resistance is too light for me. I eventually combined all the cables onto the handles and that provides the best resistance. In that mode, this is pretty good.<br /><br />I personally will not use the door anchor as I never like using door knobs or my house framing for exercise equipment. I always feel damage will be done. In fact, I had loosened a door knob once by using that for resistance bands.<br /><br />The ankle straps are nice and they are comfortable as well due to the thin internal padding. I find it awkward to use resistance bands on the ankles, but others might like this. Once again, I feel the bands will have to be doubled up to get a good resistance.<br /><br /> IN THE PACKAGE<br />- Nylon Carry Bag with cinch tie for closure<br />- A door anchor<br />- Two cushioned handles<br />- Two Velcro ankle straps with padding<br />- 5 bands totaling 100 pounds<br />--> Yellow band = 10 lbs<br />--> Blue band = 15 lbs<br />--> Red band = 20 lbs<br />--> Green band = 25 lbs<br />--> Black band = 30 lbs<br /><br />In general, this is an okay set for upper body work. My main disappointment is the lack of instructions as there was no user manual in my set. I know the Amazon site says it comes with that, but mine did not.

4312,4.0,Ingenious design; four pieces turns into one leakproof bottle,"This is an ingeniously designed infuser bottle that disassembles into four pieces (lid, main bottle cylinder, reamer, bottle base). I used this to hold some limes by using the reamer to extract the juice into the base and then letting the lime halves stay on the bottom. I then screwed the reamer into the base, then screwed the bottle cylinder on top and filled with water before putting on the cap and shaking.<br /><br />The cap has a cloth strap for carrying. The bottle is made of BPA-free plastic and is not dishwasher safe. When fruit is placed on the bottom, there is no way to get 22 ounces of liquid in this container. Nevertheless, I love the design, the color, and the ease of cleaning.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is that I have to unscrew the cap to take a drink. I would have preferred a clip top that I can just pull up and drink from. I also wish the carry strap was made of silicone because the ribbon takes time to dry. Also, note that one has to be careful not to hold the bottom section as leverage when unscrewing the cap on top. Hold the top section only because this will avoid the bottom section from being unscrewed with the top and causing a leak.

4324,5.0,Wow! Very fun and quality is solid!,"[[VIDEOID:e53d44f424ad031caa224478290f5a38]] I ordered the ‘Segway Ninebot S-Plus Smart Self-Balancing Electric Transporter, White’ for review and I would like to share my experiences and thoughts.<br /><br />I would like to start by saying that I had the opportunity many years ago, to ride on the original Segway and always thought that someday I would buy one, as it was a super fun experience. Second, I have only ever ridden one other “Hoverboard” and I happen to own that one. Although it is fun to ride, it’s crazy sensitive and not as easy to control as the Original Segway nor the Ninebot S Plus. In fact I won't even ride the other hoverboard anymore.<br /><br />So the Ninebot S Plus basically comes shipped in two parts. There is the Mainframe which is the wheels and motor, and the Steering Bar which is the part that sticks up and has padding at the top which you use your knees to steer with. Assembly was pretty straight forward (if I remember right) and I had no issues getting it all set up. After a full charge I was ready to try it out and I must say what a huge difference it was compared to the other hoverboard that I own. The auto self balancing of the Ninebot S Plus (when powered on) is absolutely incredible. Though it does take some getting used to, it’s super easy to get on and go. Unlike the smaller hoverboard I own, which is so squirrely to balance and steer by pressing forward with either your right or left foot. The Ninebot S Plus self balances and the steering is as simple as just pressing your right or left knee against the steering arm. It doesn’t take much pressure at all to turn, so you do need to be careful or you will end up on the ground as it can really easily turn-on-a-dime!<br /><br />Another thing that the Ninebot S Plus has over the other Hoverboard that I own is the huge 11” air filled rubber tires. This makes the ride so much smoother and it will easily handle rougher terrain. The solid rubber tires on the other hoverboard makes it near impossible (for me) to ride on an uneven road and forget about dirt trails. Any little bump causes the board to turn one way or the other because it messes with your balance. The Ninebot S Plus handles uneven surfaces like a champ, and I have even ridden it on some dirt trails which it also handles quite well as long as it isn't too rough.<br /><br />The Ninebot S Plus is advertised as having a 22 mile range which I will say is probably pretty accurate. I took it out to one of my favorite local parks that I bike around frequently, and I am sure I put about 10-13 miles on it and abt two hours later with a full charge, and I ended up with about 35% battery left. The park trails were mostly paved (yet bumpy and uneven in parts) with a few hills that I have no idea the grade, but it handled everything I threw at it with ease. Once I really got the hang of it, I was cruising at top speed and felt that I could have handled much more than just the max 12 mph. This leads me to my biggest gripe about the Ninebot S Plus. Though I understand the Top Speed Limit, and I appreciate the safety concerns, the annoying alarm sound that starts at about 11.5mph needs to have an option to be turned off. Once you hit near top speed that alarm starts beeping and it automatically throttles you back anyway. The throttling I can handle, but the alarm is just plain annoying. I couldn’t find settings anywhere in the mobile app to turn it off. If you are reading this Ninebot, PLEASE let us turn the alarm off ;) On a side note - you can also adjust the Max speed in the Mobile App for beginner riders. By default, upon first-use the Max speed is set to like 6mph and after you have ridden it for a bit you can use the App to bump it up to the max 12 mph.<br /><br />The included Remote Control is fun to use to drive the Ninebot S Plus around remotely, but there is a bit of a learning curve. The joystick is pretty sensitive and it gets a bit confusing when you steer it around back towards yourself. The controls at that point are backwards. Similar to flying a drone. The remote also acts as a follow-you device. This means you can walk away from the Ninebot S Plus while holding the remote, press the follow me button and the Ninebot will follow you. It’s almost like taking your dog for a walk and it can be pretty fun although I rarely use it that way as I would much rather be riding it haha. The other feature that my Daughter actually realized, is that the remote can be used to honk a horn on the Ninebot. While riding the Ninebot and holding the remote you can just press any button and the Ninebot will honk. I wish I would have known this before my trip to the park as I could have used this feature to warn the pedestrians as I came speeding up behind them as the Ninebot is so quiet.<br /><br />There is also a plug at the top of the steering arm that is for a camera that you can supposedly purchase separately, however I can not find anywhere in the states that sells it. I read a forum somewhere that said they decided not to sell this in the US market which is crazy to me. If the plug is there, shouldn’t we be able to buy and use the camera? Oh well. I guess I could rig up a Go Pro mount.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />I could go on and on about the Ninebot S Plus and how much fun it is to ride, battery life, the included remote control, 11” air filled rubber tires, 12 mph top speed (with the annoying alarm), the free Mobile App  and the 22 mile battery range. And I forgot to mention the kewl Smart Safe Lighting feature. It’s basically a headlight that will automatically adjust brightness depending how dark it is. I personally have not yet rode it in the dark outside, but have seen it working while playing with it in the house at night and it works great. Overall this is a quality item that should provide many years of family fun.

4326,2.0,Golf cart dream item..  if only it could work!!!,"Who wouldn’t love some great tunes on their golf cart..?!! As a family who owns a golf cart yet, has never golfed a day in our life - we’ve spent the last decade doing nothing but, fun rides and adventures all around our planned community with our kiddos on this toy. Music would only enhance this- and give us golf cart karaoke?!!<br /><br />Problem is.. this is a one size fits most. But, it didn’t come close to being “most” for us! How.. when we have the same speaker used in the sellers sample photo description- see photo I included..??!! Right from start when trying to attach we had issues.. this has 6 velcro straps coming out of the sides- (picture a big bug with legs!) Zero instructions included and you'd think this would be straightforward..  Trust me, we tried straps forward wrapping around pole and then, backwards just the same- we even went back to description online.. studied the photo and still had no success.<br /><br />Problems we incurred:<br /><br />•Straps are not long enough to wrap around the pole and speaker- and have enough length to close on themself. (this is placing the speaker in same spot as advertised!)<br /><br />•2 of the 3 sets of straps were sewn in backwards- so, if wrapping around the direction they’re attached- The Velcro teeth on x2 straps are on the wrong side. (Equivalent to getting two negative signs together..) hoping this is an error!<br /><br />•From photo description it appears we are missing a middle extra strap? Photo shows x1 in brown strap thru middle but, we don’t have anything of the sort...??<br /><br />•This has no bottom support or “shelf” for added protection.. this could lead speaker slide at the bottom if it were to become a loose. Golf carts bounce around a bit and vibration may cause this to slip. So, bottom support would be helpful if not, necessary to protect the speaker from falling down  and give the user peace of mind.<br /><br />•This is missing a simple but straightforward set of instructions.<br /><br />overall, this may work with a much smaller size speaker- one with hardly any girth.. Even then, it may be hit/miss to get the securely fastened. I’m afraid a smaller speaker may not produce enough sound to be heard over a motorized golf cart and will it stay safe? In leui of listing this “one size fits all/most..” this would be beneficial to list the actual length and dimension of straps so, one can verify speaker sizes that would work! Listed at a price point of $10- this could be a great find.. if, it could be successful. Tbh, It may be safer to invest more solid option to ensure it will fit/function as expected.

4379,4.0,Convenient and Interesting Feature Set,"I selected this multi-tool with the intent of replacing several smaller tools in my tool bag. My bag has gotten a little overloaded and this would be a good option for reducing some of the bag clutter in favor of a more compact and versatile single unit. It's an interesting tool with some good features, but it's not quite what I was hoping for. This is a case of failed expectations more than anything.<br /><br />Though it looks very much like a pocket knife, it is a full multi-tool. The design is quite different than any other similar tool I have seen or used as it does not emphasize the pliers. As a result, it is smaller and more compact than most multi-tools. That's a plus out of the gate.<br /><br />I could go through the list of all the features it has, but those are spelled out in the product description and would serve only to waste time and space. Instead, I will focus on the specifics that I think are worth mentioning.<br /><br />Like most multi-tools, this one does not have a spring-assisted swing-out blade, though it does lock nicely. This means you have to pull it out and manually snap it in place to lock it. If you're used to having a spring assist, this will be a disappointment, though it should not be a surprise if you've worked with other multi-tools. Also no surprise - there is no safety stop at the base of the blade, so be careful when cutting.<br /><br />The pliers are workable but are thin and awkward. The folding handle is thin while the other handle is the case of the tool, and as a result the pliers are somewhat unbalanced in the hand and a little awkward to use when you first work with them. The idea behind a multi-tool is convenience and not to be the primary tool, so this is forgiveable.<br /><br />The bits that come with the tool set this unit apart from any other I have used. Instead of one or two swing-out drivers, this one instead has a single post and a set of bits that can be changed. This gives a tremendous amount of flexibility. There's just one problem - the post does not lock in place and can fold in on you while in use. This represents the one real complaint I have with the tool as a whole - locking the post would have been an easy feature to implement and woul dhave made the tool a lot safer. Please use some caution when working with the bits.<br /><br />This is not a bad tool at all, but it is not perfect. It is designed for convenience and it does work well. My main concerns are safety-related, and even so one should keep in mind that this is a convenience tool, not one on which you should rely every day. If you're looking for a multi-tool, this is a reasonable choice that's worth a look.",0,"['tool', 'several', 'smaller', 'tool', 'tool', 'bag', 'bag', 'gotten', 'little', 'good', 'option', 'bag', 'compact', 'single', 'unit', 'tool', 'good', 'feature', 'quite', 'hoping', 'case', 'anything', 'though', 'look', 'much', 'like', 'pocket', 'knife', 'full', 'tool', 'design', 'quite', 'different', 'similar', 'tool', 'seen', 'used', 'doe', 'result', 'smaller', 'compact', 'tool', 'plus', 'feature', 'product', 'description', 'waste', 'time', 'space', 'instead', 'think', 'worth', 'like', 'tool', 'one', 'doe', 'spring', 'blade', 'though', 'doe', 'lock', 'nicely', 'mean', 'pull', 'snap', 'place', 'lock', 'used', 'spring', 'though', 'worked', 'tool', 'also', 'safety', 'stop', 'base', 'blade', 'careful', 'thin', 'folding', 'handle', 'thin', 'handle', 'case', 'tool', 'result', 'somewhat', 'hand', 'little', 'use', 'first', 'work', 'idea', 'behind', 'tool', 'tool', 'bit', 'come', 'tool', 'set', 'unit', 'apart', 'used', 'instead', 'one', 'two', 'one', 'instead', 'single', 'post', 'set', 'bit', 'give', 'amount', 'one', 'problem', 'post', 'doe', 'lock', 'place', 'fold', 'use', 'one', 'real', 'complaint', 'tool', 'whole', 'post', 'easy', 'feature', 'made', 'tool', 'lot', 'please', 'use', 'working', 'bit', 'bad', 'tool', 'perfect', 'designed', 'doe', 'work', 'well', 'main', 'concern', 'safety', 'even', 'one', 'keep', 'mind', 'tool', 'one', 'every', 'day', 'looking', 'tool', 'choice', 'worth', 'look']"

4394,5.0,Decent Camping Lantern,"[[VIDEOID:7cace53d54dd11d9ca86d52ec20f0527]] If you ever go camping or if you live in an area where there are frequent power outages you understand the need for a good lantern. I have worked with several lanterns and while I have used some that are a little brighter or a little more compact, this one is a decent one that has some good features. Besides having a couple of operation modes, it is chargeable via solar energy.<br /><br />This is a reasonably bright lantern but it is not blindingly bright like some others I have seen. This is a trade-off in my book. If you are expecting something that is bright enough to light a small camp area and allow you to read by it, this is a decent lamp. If you want something to light a 20'x20' room it is not strong enough to provide color recognition through the whole room.<br /><br />This lantern has a rechargeable battery that can be removed and plugged in to the provided power adapter for recharging. It can also be opened up to expose a pair of solar panels so it can be charged up via solar power. There is something very important to understand about solar charging, though – using the solar panels to charge this lantern takes a lot longer than if plugging the pack in. I have not tried to completely charge the lantern via solar power but in my experience solar charging takes roughly 4 to 5 times longer. That said, if you do not have the option to plug in, the solar panel is a superb option.<br /><br />This lantern seems to be solidly made and resistant to easy breakage. So, I believe it would survive a drop from a short distance, though I would hesitate to test this theory. The hook loop on top is plastic but it seems sturdy enough to handle frequent use and abuse.<br /><br />This lantern has two operation modes. It has two brightnesses – dim and bright. The dim light is enough to light a hallway when carrying this lantern though it is not going to work for tromping through the woods. The bright setting is not actually all that bright but it is enough to see through a large room and make out everything in it, though it does not cast enough light to see colors clearly at more than 10' or so.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little lantern. It seems to be made well and it can be charged by either a power adapter or solar power. Just keep in mind that it is not going to charge quickly if using the solar cells to charge it up.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4398,5.0,"Strong, Sturdy, and Durable","Lawn chairs are useful for many purposes. They come in handy when you attend events and are a practical addition to your backyard. They are not all created equally, though, and one of the better ones I have used is this chair, the Tepui Single Chair.<br /><br />Taken from its transporting bag, this lawn chair is ready to use- you just have to pull the legs apart and stand it up. It has a cup holder for drinks and I like that it is placed below the chair, attached to the leg. With other lawn chairs, the cup holder is right there, on the arm of the chair, and your drink can get in the way of resting your arm. I also like that the covers on each arm are removable. They are held in place with Velcro and if you don’t prefer them, that is perfectly fine, as they are easy to remove.<br /><br />With comfort, this chair is better than most. I don’t get that ‘sinking feeling’ like I often do with other lawn chairs. This one feels more secure and the weight limit rating confirms that it is, indeed, stronger than the average lawn chair. Another cool feature is the mesh back. It allows air to flow through and it does make a difference at keeping you cool and preventing perspiration from forming on your back.<br /><br />This lawn chair is easy enough to fold back up and place into the carrying bag when you’re finished. I should point out that this chair is heavier than others so carrying it for a long distance could be tiring. However, it is also stronger and more durable than others. I am willing to put up with the added weight to have a better lawn chair.<br /><br />I have several different lawn chairs for home and event use. This lawn chair from Tepui is an excellent one overall, delivering on comfort, quality, and strength. It is the best lawn chair I currently own and now that I have used it a few times, I am ready to toss my other, cheaper chairs in the trash and replace them all with this one.

4418,5.0,"A life saver for locking ""Halkey-Roberts"" style valves","We own a couple of paddle boards that use what I thought was a proprietary interlocking air valve. It looks sort of like a bayonet that twists into place, and can be released by twisting the pin inside to hold it open. They came with manual pumps that are a royal pain to use, but I couldn't get them to fill with any of my standard air pumps because the valve was so specific.<br />I recently picked up an inflatable raft that uses the same kind of valve, and after doing some Googling, I discovered it IS, in fact, a standard called the Halkey-Roberts mini valve. Well, sure enough, they DO make pumps like this one that fit that sort of twist-lock valve! I'm SO happy I found this after years of assuming it was some weird non-standard. It works great on both my paddle boards AND raft, saving me from getting tired of pumping before we even make it onto the water!<br /><br />It isn't as fast as some of my other standard pumps, but to be fair we are pumping to a very high PSI to make things like the paddle board rigid. There's a lot of pressure required. Meanwhile, I like that it has an automatic shut off you so can leave it going and walk away once you set the desired pressure. No more babysitting the pump. The cord isn't particularly long, but I use it with a portable battery bank that offers a 12V DC port so that's fine. I DO wish it had other options like AC power or just a DC input for us to power it however we wish instead of limiting us to an automotive style plug, but I can't complain too much.

However, the type of food eaten will effect the efficiency of these utensils.. *note: they are far from norm. of daily use but, expected.. the knife is to cut/separate simple things vs. using dirty hands! Fork has stable prongs to pick things up with ease. Spoon does the trick as well- but, is a tad smaller in size..<br />•Color coding is sublime.. especially, if you have kids, these things matter! Assign each person a color- Then, it’s their job to wash, pack, keep track of, and/or- store as expected.<br />•washing with soap/water will work fine on plastic. Just be sure to rinse/clean INSIDE the knife sheath too!! If using knife while eating and restoring to one unit, this can get food yuck inside- so, inspect all pieces before thinking this is clean and packing away.<br />•Keep in mind- overall size Is still smaller then, Standard utensil.. Even with both sides connected. May be a total bonus if, space is an issue- but, may be harder to use for some larger adults.<br />• These do not come with any type of personal cover or, storage bag. For germ safety/keeping clean, this would be great if included. But, one must provide protective cover on their own.<br />•safety/peace of mind- this can be used for all ages without worry of injury.

These gloves, however, come with their own batteries and are charged via a DC port (I think that's what it's called).

For this reason alone, I would skip these.<br /><br />In terms of functionality, these work great. They are comfortable, heat up quickly, and get to a good range of temperatures. The gloves also have a stylish design. Another thing that I liked about these is that they aren’t SO big/puffy, like most heated gloves.<br /><br />These would be 4 star gloves if they used a more common battery pack/charger.

The drain is covered by a fine mesh screen and if you’ve ever used a fine mesh sink strainer you know that they clog up quickly. So now this fine mesh is constantly clogged up and you can’t remove it so there’s no way to clean it. so now every time I have water in the sink I have to stand there with a stick or some thing scraping the mesh so that it will drain. It’s aggravating.  And unnecessary. They could’ve put a plastic grid in there because if something goes down the drain, it’s not the end of the world because it only goes 2 feet before it either ends up in a tank or on the ground. So the fine mesh was a poor design choice.  Maybe I’ll drill some holes in it I don’t know.  But it is definitely aggravating to use right now.<br /><br />Old review..........I have this set up in my art studio shed which does not have running water.

4476,1.0,Not impressed with the customer support,"Initially the fitbit flex worked really well and I was very pleased. All the sudden it would still charge fine but a full charge that initially would last almost a week, was now barely giving me 24 hours of usage of the flex.<br />I contacted customer support and the only way to do so is using email. It takes them about 2 days to get back to you (had issues before and it took that time both times). They told me the firmware needed to be upgraded and would improve the performance of the flex.

Now I have to get it off again and pack the whole thing back up.<br /><br />Amazon customer service is shipping what they say will be a brand new scooter that works, and they're also sending UPS to pick up the old one for no charge. Hopefully this will get resolved but this is all a real disappointing pain in the neck.<br /><br />UPDATE: Got the replacement from Amazon in a few days as promised. It definitely seems new, since there's packaging and safety stickers that weren't included with the first one I got. No scratches either. The brake lever went on easily and works well. But best of all it actually works. Pick up the front wheel and hit the throttle and it maxes out at 17.9 MPH with no load.

There is no elastic, nor ability to adjust, so choose wisely.<br /><br />Medium fits 55-58CM (22.2""-22.8"");<br />Large fits 58-61CM (23.03""- 24.0"")  ----my head measures 23.75"", this fits very well.<br /><br />Despite that the product description states that the hat is adjustable, it is NOT. The only portion that is ""adjustable"" is the optional chin strap. On mine, it can be kept clipped on, or taken off. There is a toggle to make it tighter against the face, or allow it to be loose.<br /><br />The interior has what appears to be an elastic band, but it is not elastic. It's purpose is more like that of a sweat band or to provide some grip, but it doesn't not stretch. This will either fit, or it won't.<br /><br />I normally like Jeff & Aimmy products, and overall I like this too. I just want to see a cleaned up, more accurate description. (and what are with all the reviews for this product yet are for something not being sold here?)<br /><br />The material is soft, light. The brim is long but can be folded back some as needed.<br />The slit for the pony tail is subtle. So it will blend in when not in use. But to use it, is a little awkward as you will have to feed the pony tail through a narrow slit. Not bad though. Doable.<br /><br />I do appreciate that there are size offerings for larger heads. It is rare- extremely- that I find a womens hat that fits anything above 22.5"". MY cranium is 23.75"", so I can't wear most stuff. SO unless you have a bigger head like mine, you will most likely be wanting a medium. If your ""large"" is too big, then you ordered the wrong size as the size large is accurate (23.03""- 24.0""). It will just fit if your head it 24"". Might be snug. It fits mine just right at 23.75"". Or if your medium is too small.. then again, likely wrong size. selected. Either way, make sure you got what you ordered.<br /><br />I use sun hats (when I can find them in my size) a lot.  I prefer to avoid the sun. I keep it off my face and body, especially during the summer months. Between sun sensitive meds, rosacea, and just wanting added protection from UV rays, a sun hat is a great thing to have. Since I can add this to my list of companies that sell larger sized hats I will possibly be back to purchase more. I like the overall look (even if I did get something different than anticipated).",0,"['hat', 'color', 'black', 'black', 'supposed', 'receive', 'hat', 'black', 'black', 'may', 'come', 'review', 'include', 'hat', 'one', 'make', 'sure', 'take', 'look', 'sizing', 'two', 'size', 'available', 'medium', 'large', 'elastic', 'ability', 'adjust', 'medium', 'fit', 'large', 'fit', 'head', 'fit', 'well', 'despite', 'product', 'description', 'state', 'hat', 'adjustable', 'adjustable', 'strap', 'mine', 'kept', 'taken', 'make', 'face', 'allow', 'loose', 'elastic', 'band', 'elastic', 'purpose', 'like', 'sweat', 'band', 'provide', 'grip', 'doe', 'stretch', 'either', 'fit', 'normally', 'like', 'product', 'overall', 'like', 'want', 'see', 'accurate', 'description', 'review', 'product', 'yet', 'something', 'material', 'soft', 'light', 'long', 'back', 'needed', 'use', 'use', 'little', 'bad', 'though', 'appreciate', 'size', 'larger', 'head', 'extremely', 'find', 'hat', 'fit', 'anything', 'wear', 'stuff', 'unless', 'bigger', 'head', 'like', 'mine', 'likely', 'medium', 'large', 'big', 'ordered', 'wrong', 'size', 'size', 'large', 'accurate', 'fit', 'head', 'might', 'snug', 'fit', 'mine', 'right', 'medium', 'small', 'likely', 'wrong', 'size', 'either', 'way', 'make', 'sure', 'got', 'ordered', 'use', 'sun', 'hat', 'find', 'size', 'lot', 'prefer', 'sun', 'keep', 'face', 'body', 'especially', 'summer', 'month', 'sun', 'added', 'protection', 'sun', 'hat', 'great', 'thing', 'since', 'add', 'company', 'larger', 'sized', 'hat', 'back', 'purchase', 'like', 'overall', 'look', 'even', 'get', 'something', 'different']"

4542,2.0,Potentiality Unsafe,"I wanted to like this, I really did! It fit my Sig Sauer P365 but very loosely. That was the first problem I encountered. The grip of the outer material is not in question. It's good. In the waistband either up against skin or underwear the holster stayed in place and allowed for an easy draw. Too easy. The holster also allowed for an easy drop to the floor because it in no way holds tightly to your firearm. I bent over to pick something up and my gun hit the floor! I can't imagine what would have happened had I been out at the store. No matter how I jammed the gun in it just didn't stay securely inside the holster.<br />But my biggest problem. Which was brought up by another user in a Sig owners group, he said ""See if you can squeeze the trigger while it's in the holster."" So I did. . . and I found that it really isn't that difficult to pull the trigger while it holstered. Yes, my firearm does not have a manual safety but other users sang the praises of this holster so I gave it a try. Simply squeezing my pocket caused the striker to drop. I feel a lighter or similar sized and shaped hard object, a key fob even, could cause an accidental discharge.<br />Even if my firearm had a manual safety I honestly couldn't recommend this holster just based on how poorly it retains the weapon.",1,"['wanted', 'like', 'really', 'fit', 'first', 'problem', 'grip', 'material', 'good', 'either', 'skin', 'place', 'easy', 'easy', 'also', 'easy', 'drop', 'floor', 'way', 'hold', 'something', 'gun', 'hit', 'floor', 'store', 'matter', 'gun', 'stay', 'securely', 'inside', 'problem', 'another', 'user', 'group', 'said', 'see', 'found', 'really', 'difficult', 'pull', 'yes', 'doe', 'safety', 'user', 'gave', 'try', 'simply', 'pocket', 'drop', 'feel', 'lighter', 'similar', 'sized', 'hard', 'key', 'even', 'cause', 'even', 'safety', 'honestly', 'recommend', 'based']"

4544,3.0,4/5 ain't bad ...but it isn't great either,"These are admittedly a good deal--if all 5 work. If only 4 work, it's not. Unfortunately this was the case. Only 4 actually worked. I dropped a note to the seller explaining I tried good batteries which worked fine in the other 4 flashlights, but one flashlight simply would not work. I explained I had tried several different batteries which were known to be good. Unfortunately, there seems to be a language barrier with the seller. After this detailed explanation about trying several different batteries the seller proceeded to ask me ...wait for it... if I had batteries in the flashlight.<br /><br />(*facepalm*)<br /><br />The seller then went on to ask me to take VIDEO of the flashlight not working and upload it so they could see it. Seriously? For a $2.50 item? I'm sorry, but my time is more valuable than that. I ended up just tossing the defective flashlight. The seller ended up refunding a few bucks for the defective flashlight though, so I aded a star back on for that. The other four work fine.<br /><br />Note the focal adjuster moves very easily--there is little to no friction to hold in in place. This makes the flashlight useless in terms of self-defense, as the semi-sharp front edge moves too easily to be either safe or effective. You are more likely to pinch or cut your hands on the mechanism while trying to use it as it moves and rotates quite freely. Other similar tactical flashlights I own have a slightly different design to the focal mechanism and significant effort is required to move them--meaning they stay put, as they should. This is a very cheap product.

4545,1.0,I had a warm drink with no ice after 4 hours or so. Do not recommend.,"I have 3 of these.<br /><br />I bought 3 bottles. I bought this one. The Fresh Taste one and Hydracentials (2 of those actually....old and new style)<br /><br />After 3 weeks of using them regularly, here is my experience.<br /><br />H2O<br />Started off great. I thought. I put ice in it and thought it stayed cold. This bottle was full of ice (ice goes in first...to the top), then water and then water flavoring and it is shaken up.<br /><br />Fresh Taste<br />It is used exclusively for kefir. I fill it up with ice. Add some kefir, a little water and perhaps a flavoring packet. Shake it up and it's ready to use.<br /><br />Hydracentials<br />The old bottle I gave to my mother who refuses to return it (which is fine....she's my mother lol). She loves it and I loved it before here.<br />The new bottle is different only slightly and is used exclusively for water. Again, I fill it up to the top with ice, then add water.<br /><br />After doing this several night (well nearly 3 weeks), here is what I found. I also did this at about 8pm this evening.<br /><br />The Hydracentials is very cold. Usually there is still ice in it in the morning and often until the next afternoon and evening.<br />The Fresh Taste is also very cold. There is always some ice in the kefir mixture and it's more than safe enough to drink.<br /><br />This brings me to the H2O bottle. At 8pm I filled all 3 bottles as usual. At 12:30am. This bottle had no ice left in it and it was somewhat warm. I thought it did better than that when I first got it but have actually comparison tested it for the last few days. It does not stay cold. I don't know what I could have done to it but I will actually need to toss it. It does not last as long as a Walmart thermos. In addition, the metal part rusts. Not much but I have not had for that long.<br /><br />Update<br />Used again today. I have not been paying much attention to it but went to pick it up and the bottle was sweating. The other two bottles were not. It has been sitting, like the other two bottles in a 75F room. I had to sit it on the carpet (or get a coaster) to keep it from making my desk wet.<br /><br />So, buyer beware!",1,"['bought', 'bottle', 'bought', 'one', 'taste', 'one', 'actually', 'old', 'new', 'style', 'week', 'using', 'experience', 'started', 'great', 'thought', 'put', 'ice', 'thought', 'cold', 'bottle', 'full', 'ice', 'ice', 'first', 'top', 'water', 'water', 'taste', 'used', 'fill', 'ice', 'add', 'little', 'water', 'perhaps', 'ready', 'use', 'old', 'bottle', 'gave', 'return', 'fine', 'lol', 'love', 'loved', 'new', 'bottle', 'different', 'slightly', 'used', 'water', 'fill', 'top', 'ice', 'add', 'water', 'several', 'night', 'well', 'week', 'found', 'also', 'cold', 'usually', 'still', 'ice', 'morning', 'often', 'next', 'taste', 'also', 'cold', 'always', 'ice', 'safe', 'enough', 'drink', 'bottle', 'filled', 'bottle', 'bottle', 'ice', 'left', 'somewhat', 'warm', 'thought', 'better', 'first', 'got', 'actually', 'last', 'day', 'doe', 'stay', 'cold', 'know', 'done', 'actually', 'need', 'doe', 'last', 'long', 'addition', 'metal', 'part', 'much', 'long', 'update', 'used', 'today', 'much', 'went', 'bottle', 'two', 'bottle', 'sitting', 'like', 'two', 'bottle', 'room', 'sit', 'get', 'keep', 'making', 'desk', 'wet']"

4547,5.0,Good Board,"I am new to SUP. This board has been perfect for a beginner. It was easy to set up, easy to store, easy to transport, and easy to SUP. The board came with a pump (to inflate and deflate the board), a bag (to transport and store the empty board), an ankle leash, a repair kit, and a bungee (attached to the top front of the board for storage).<br /><br />The board deflated is pretty heavy. The bag that comes with the board is backpack style and makes it easy to carry, even with all my other gear and kids.<br /><br />The pump worked easily and quickly. My pressure valve on my pump did not work, so I just had to guess and hope for the best when inflating.<br /><br />The 3 fins on the board make it easy to stay on a forward path. They do make it a little more difficult to turn, but made it simple to stand and paddle in a straight direction without much practice.<br /><br />I also tried out a hard &#34;beginners&#34; board from a paddle board rental place. The inflatable is so much easier for a beginner. It just moves less side to side in the water and seems more stable. Not to mention being easier to transport to and from the water.<br /><br />The surface of this board is very grippy on your feet. You can ride barefoot or with shoes on without worrying about slipping. The handle is perfectly placed to easily carry it once it is inflated.<br /><br />Overall, a super high quality board.

So, in the Vine program I see this one week as an eligible item and I jumped. Well, the real upside to this is that it is adjustable, so you can add and subtract weights. But, that's all that seemed to be a plus for me. On the downside, the vest comes with only one strap which is over my chest area (definitely could have used a bottom strap). I found it extremely uncomfortable while walking, with the vest shifting all around while I walked from foot to foot (and the faster I walked, the worse it got). I was wearing this under my t-shirt with just a sports bra and found it scratchy and irritating and when I sweat, it became extremely uncomfortable. I ended up wearing it over my t-shirt which, although it resolved the scratchy feel to my bare skin and some of the shifting problem, but it made me look dopey as I was walking. In fairness, I rated this a three star. I figure if you are using for mat work (pilates or weights) it would probably do the trick for extra resistance.

And while I can say that this is a great pack for just myself or for my + a child’s stuff, it is not practical/big enough for me to carry for my stuff plus my 3 small kids. It was stuffed to the brim with our 4 light jackets, water bottles and a granola bar each. The pack itself is beautifully made with quality material and good zippers. I love the hip belt pocket, the generously sized side water bottle pocket and I love the top backpack styled opening. All that said, this is not the pack for me at this point in my life. With 3 small kids, even our simple hikes of 1-3 hours require more capacity. I also own the Osprey Tempest 30, and if you plan to carry stuff for more than 1-2 people, I would recommend sizing up to that pack.

I contacted the seller and was able to get the remaining track sent pretty quickly.  When the new box came, it was a box identical to the original, containing only one 3-ft section of track.  Not that I was needing more than one section of track, but if they just shopped me another “product” off the shelf and this one also only had one track, that means there are probably others with only one section?  This leads me to wonder if there’s a packaging problem that is causing boxes to be sent with only one piece of track?<br /><br />More good:  The second package came with an additional carriage and all the hardware to install it, so that was good.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with the purchase.

4615,1.0,Far Too Large for 1” Handlebar; Outrageously Expensive,"These BLACK BUFFED FOAM GRIPS (Small NPVC Foam Handle Covers for Fitness, Home, Lawn and Garden, Bikes; Pack of 2) are far too large for a 1” handlebar.

These cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as “foam” grips.<br /><br />The price (about $10 on Amazon) is outrageous.

4617,3.0,Good all inclusive set- read must know info. below to be sure it works for you!,"Ordered these for my son who’s struggled through quarantine to get an appropriate work out.. I know, I know- we’re all singing the same sad quarantine song (some in better tune than others-ha-ah!) This was an all inclusive workout set sold at a decent price point and although we had high hopes it would be as great as our gym membership.. (yeah, right!! We all need realistic expectations ..) this had its perks and drawback- ultimately, I would have liked to rate it 3.5 star. I would suggest this is set mean for beginners/novice level exercise enthusiast.. and could meet those needs fairly well. (Used 2-3x week and for 15-30min. at a time..) However, this might fall short for those expecting a little more from their equipment..<br /><br />If purchasing keep in mind:<br /><br />-The grip handles are smaller than some adult male hands..(at least in our house!) Obviously, this could prove problematic if.. ones grip is compromised right from the start. However, an adult females hand seems to fit the grip without issue.<br /><br />-As with any elastic band the stretch is tighter when you begin. This set offers varied resistance (clearly marked by color) after x30 day use.. Lower resistance bands are showing more signs of “slack.” (Nothing has snapped on us! But, the lesser band is much easier to pull.. and I would beg to differ it’s because we’re getting so much stronger!!) Higher levels still have plenty of resistance but, we haven’t used nearly as much so, they stretch out - just something to keep in mind.<br /><br />-Protect door jam with extra padding!! As these are braced against “wood” with a soft rounded ball, we have found- not all door jams are created equal (i’m pretty sure our door jams are made of wood composite?!!) So, be careful and add a small cut out of foam, washcloth or dish towel.. Anything you can easily rig to buffer The wall and protect it- bc, we noticed small indents being left on the door jam itself- not what we wanted and overtime without protection… It’ll only get worse!<br /><br />-Appreciate the bag this came with to store all the items in along with the extra straps/gadgets. This does have instructions- however, they’re a bit tricky to read- just know you can Google a “how to video“ and obtain the info. easily enough . Would have loved to see this set contain added buffer pad for walls.. even a few photos with instructions- possibly something included in the future? I’d also appreciate including a magic eraser for the walls! The black rubber can leave small markings… Yes! These easily come off with wall eraser- Hence, the perk of including one in the bag!<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad set up. It can give a person- a good resistance workout.. It just has a few idiosyncrasies to work around.. I suggest knowing your audience and their physical size and ability… If, you do prior to any ordering- and are sure to protect the physical structure of the door when setting up- then, one should get what you need from this workout set.<br /><br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",1,"['ordered', 'son', 'get', 'work', 'know', 'know', 'better', 'others', 'workout', 'set', 'decent', 'price', 'point', 'although', 'high', 'hope', 'great', 'gym', 'right', 'need', 'liked', 'rate', 'star', 'set', 'mean', 'beginner', 'level', 'exercise', 'need', 'fairly', 'well', 'used', 'week', 'time', 'however', 'might', 'fall', 'short', 'expecting', 'little', 'equipment', 'keep', 'mind', 'grip', 'handle', 'smaller', 'adult', 'hand', 'least', 'house', 'one', 'grip', 'right', 'start', 'however', 'adult', 'hand', 'seems', 'fit', 'grip', 'without', 'issue', 'elastic', 'band', 'stretch', 'set', 'offer', 'resistance', 'color', 'day', 'use', 'lower', 'resistance', 'band', 'nothing', 'band', 'much', 'easier', 'pull', 'getting', 'much', 'higher', 'level', 'still', 'plenty', 'resistance', 'used', 'much', 'stretch', 'something', 'keep', 'mind', 'protect', 'door', 'extra', 'padding', 'wood', 'soft', 'ball', 'found', 'door', 'pretty', 'sure', 'door', 'made', 'wood', 'careful', 'add', 'small', 'cut', 'foam', 'towel', 'anything', 'easily', 'wall', 'protect', 'noticed', 'small', 'left', 'door', 'wanted', 'without', 'protection', 'get', 'appreciate', 'bag', 'came', 'store', 'item', 'along', 'extra', 'strap', 'doe', 'instruction', 'however', 'bit', 'read', 'know', 'video', 'info', 'easily', 'enough', 'loved', 'see', 'set', 'added', 'pad', 'wall', 'even', 'photo', 'instruction', 'something', 'included', 'also', 'appreciate', 'including', 'wall', 'black', 'rubber', 'leave', 'small', 'yes', 'easily', 'come', 'wall', 'including', 'one', 'bag', 'overall', 'bad', 'set', 'give', 'person', 'good', 'resistance', 'workout', 'work', 'around', 'physical', 'size', 'ability', 'sure', 'protect', 'physical', 'door', 'setting', 'one', 'get', 'need', 'workout', 'set', 'hope', 'info', 'help', 'feel', 'free', 'let', 'know']"

4631,2.0,"Short term review: good capacity, many negative aspects.","I do like having these bottles for bikepacking. It makes the difference between having to carry some kind of bladder vs making the jump between towns in the middle of summer during midday. The 1L capacity is the big appeal for me.<br /><br />For me, the Camelback Podium water bottles are the best I've used. I would rate the Podium at 4 stars. I've gotten used to the annoyances and now I have really on positive associations with that water bottle .<br /><br />This Zefal bottle gets additional points for capacity, and loses many points for the following criteria:<br />Distinct plastic taste that appears very quickly. With my other water bottles, I detect some leeching only when I leave water in the bottle overnight or longer. With the Zefal, it's almost immediate. That worries me.<br /><br />Requires too much force to seal the lid. On my first bikepacking trip with these, I kept wasting water because my first squeeze after each stop would go on my face and jersey, in addition to my mouth. I'm used to it now and I know how hard I need to muscle on the lids.<br /><br />No jet nozzle. This is the same basic design as water bottles had 40 years ago. It's not horrible - it works like it's supposed to; OTOH if the Camelback is 4 stars then this design is worth much less.<br /><br />Branding: I simply feel strange about branding on really low-end items. IDK - maybe I'm afraid that people with think that I think this is great water bottle? Maybe I shouldn't take that out on the product. I definitely don't mind the Camelback logo, no matter how outlandish and counter to my design taste, and yet with these bottles even the conservative branding seems to be in bad taste.<br /><br />Overall, this bottle simply fails to meet my criterion for good cycling gear: its interface/use is not transparent. I.e. instead of simply using it routinely / out of habit / on muscle memory, I'm always aware of opening the valve, tasting plastic, and remembering to close the valve as I return it to the cage. Gear that I consider over the threshold for good sinks down out of sight much faster than my habit formation with these - assuming I will ever get used to them. At this point it seems more likely that next summer I'll set out of find a better solution to this same problem.<br /><br />I simply don't like these bottles.<br /><br />Overall this feels like many levels of quality down from the Camelback bottles. I find the capacity appealing and really nothing else.

4633,4.0,"Much more light than expected, very lightweight, uses 4 AA batteries, easy to store & use","These are small - roughly the same size as a coke can - and that makes them the perfect size for some very specific uses. They weigh almost nothing, even with the four AA batteries inserted. The little handle on top is just tall enough to hang these lanterns from a drawer pull or in our house, a push down style door knob. With the light weight, the lantern hangs without affecting the use of the door handle so you can have light in an interior room or basement while hunting for a fuse box etc and know where the exit is. I also like that the exterior of the lantern is a bit of a rubberized texture - setting it on our marble bathroom counter in the dark wasn't as risky as it would've been with just slick plastic. These are small and weigh very little - a slippery surface or wet hands could be a problem without the textured case.<br /><br />The light is very bright and clear white. No yellow hue to it at all and these LED bulbs turn on instantly. We tested the lights in a pitch black garage, closet and walking around in the back yard at 11pm. They are bright enough to use to get dressed or find your way around the garage with no problems at all. Use in the yard was fine, but a flashlight is better as a directional aimed beam for walking. My one star deduction is because I dropped one of the lanterns from hip high and it came apart when it landed (a fall of two feet onto a thick bath mat). The batteries flew out and the bottom cracked apart. However - the light DID work afterwards and we just super glued the crack back together.

The number one issue with hers is that she claims to this day that the water tastes weird. This particular Hydration Backpack has not had that issue, at least to me. Yes there was a bit of a taste in the beginning but after a few uses it is not as noticeable. I think this is probably an issue with any of these as the tubing and plastic bladder has a smell to begin with but eventually after some use and washing, it fades away. This Outdoor Revolution 16L Hydration Backpack is very well made. The bladder and tubing seems to be of a good quality. The backpack itself is well constructed with no loose or fraying of the stitching. It's quite comfortable to wear even when filled with water.

4666,2.0,Does It Work?,"While tempted I haven't zapped myself with this and none of my friends are willing to let me test this on them. It does make a reasonably loud zappy sound when you trigger it but I have no idea how effective it is. What I can report having tested are the flashlight and siren. Flashlight at full charge is good enough to help you find a lock in the dark or something you might have dropped but it's not very bright or focused. Just a dim widely spread beam. I don't think the siren would do much to frighten a criminal away, it's barely loud enough to be annoying. A mugger is likely to just hit you and take it away. It might work as a signal device if you fell and needed help. Another problem with this is all three switches; light, siren and stun gun are pink, the marking icon on the buttons are small and hard to distinguish. In an emergency figuring out which button is which could mean a lot. The siren and stun functionality also have an on/off switch on the base that needs to be activated before either feature can be used (the flashlight function is always available). The big problem with the switch is it stands quite proud of the base and can easily be bumped or nudge on, then you have a live stun gun in your pocket and a button that also easily pressed as you fumble this out of your pocket. I can just imagine resting your hand on your leg and shocking yourself completely by accident. If the 'safety' switch were flush or covered in some way to make it hard to accidentally activate I might have rated it higher. As it stands it's just as dangerous to the owner as it is to a would be attacker, maybe more so.",1,"['friend', 'let', 'test', 'doe', 'make', 'loud', 'sound', 'idea', 'flashlight', 'flashlight', 'full', 'charge', 'good', 'enough', 'help', 'find', 'lock', 'dark', 'something', 'might', 'bright', 'think', 'much', 'away', 'barely', 'loud', 'enough', 'annoying', 'likely', 'hit', 'take', 'away', 'might', 'work', 'device', 'fell', 'needed', 'help', 'another', 'problem', 'three', 'switch', 'light', 'gun', 'button', 'small', 'hard', 'emergency', 'button', 'mean', 'lot', 'also', 'switch', 'base', 'need', 'either', 'feature', 'used', 'flashlight', 'function', 'always', 'available', 'big', 'problem', 'switch', 'stand', 'quite', 'base', 'easily', 'live', 'gun', 'pocket', 'button', 'also', 'easily', 'pocket', 'hand', 'leg', 'completely', 'switch', 'way', 'make', 'hard', 'might', 'higher', 'stand', 'maybe']"

4691,5.0,Great Paddle (even for a first-timer!)- Would highly recommend!,"Love this paddle! This is my first paddle, as I am a pickleball newbie. For context, I've been playing ~8 hours per week for the past couple months. After using the wooden paddles for a few weeks, I decided to get my own.<br /><br />This paddle is absolutely my favorite of any of the paddles I've tried, (and I tried paddles of all shapes, sizes, weights, etc). The elongated shape is helpful when reaching for balls and slamming, although the sweet spot is a little smaller than on a wide-body or standard paddle. The slightly smaller sweet spot has not affected my play.<br /><br />The face of this PCKL paddle is a textured graphite and it makes a very satisfying sound/feel when you hit the ball just right. The paddle is also on the lighter side (weighing ~7.5 oz), which allows me to hit to ball a little harder without it going way out of bounds.<br /><br />Lastly, I really like the look and design of the paddle. The white/green look is very clean, and the green outline around the face helps you easily spot it when in a stack of paddles (at a pickup court).<br /><br />I have 2 gripes, both very minor. One is that the length of the handle is a *tiny* bit short for my liking--another few centimeters would have been perfect (that said, I am used to how the length now). Secondly, the stock grip doesn't absorb sweat very well, so I'd recommend adding some grip tape (the paddle comes with some!).<br /><br />While the common wisdom is that elongated paddles are for experienced players only, I am thrilled with this as my first paddle, and I would absolutely get it again.",0,"['love', 'paddle', 'first', 'paddle', 'playing', 'hour', 'per', 'week', 'past', 'couple', 'month', 'using', 'paddle', 'week', 'decided', 'get', 'paddle', 'absolutely', 'favorite', 'paddle', 'tried', 'tried', 'paddle', 'shape', 'size', 'weight', 'etc', 'shape', 'helpful', 'ball', 'although', 'spot', 'little', 'smaller', 'wide', 'body', 'standard', 'paddle', 'slightly', 'smaller', 'spot', 'play', 'face', 'paddle', 'make', 'sound', 'feel', 'hit', 'ball', 'right', 'paddle', 'also', 'lighter', 'side', 'allows', 'hit', 'ball', 'little', 'without', 'going', 'way', 'really', 'like', 'look', 'design', 'paddle', 'white', 'green', 'look', 'clean', 'green', 'around', 'face', 'help', 'easily', 'spot', 'paddle', 'one', 'length', 'handle', 'tiny', 'bit', 'short', 'another', 'perfect', 'said', 'used', 'length', 'grip', 'doe', 'sweat', 'well', 'recommend', 'grip', 'tape', 'paddle', 'come', 'paddle', 'first', 'paddle', 'absolutely', 'get']"
4692,4.0,Nice Resistance Bands,"I've never ordered a piece of exercise equipment like this, so I'm not sure what to review. I have weights to lift, but have elbow joint problems due to a work-related injury back in 1999, and sometimes even a 3-pound weight was too much for my elbows. I thought these bands would work so that I could vary the resistance I put on my arms when I move them, depending on how my elbows were feeling.

I'd probably say for thin people, this bag would be fine but if you have an athletic or overweight build, it's going to feel too small for you.  I've actually been using this bag more as a quilt in a pinch.  It is comfortable in that respect for me.  The stuff sack it goes in is not that great.  It ripped after very limited use.  The straps for cinching the bag closed do not hold as tight as you may want them too.  The straps will slip back to a position where they're comfortable so it's hard to compress the bag down as much as you'd like.

4703,4.0,"High capacity and leak-proof, but there are caveats","I received this as a free review sample. The reason why I subtracted a star is the bottle has a seam on both sides, indicating that it was made from two halves that were 'welded' together. I have owned bottles made this way that split when accidentally dropped when full or nearly full.<br /><br />The main features are capacity and large infusion basket. A major plus is that it effectively seals, so there is no need to worry about spills or leakage. It has a silicone 'O' ring on the cap, as well as a silicone stopper on the top that deals the drinking spout.<br /><br />Do note that you CANNOT clean this is a dishwasher. However, hand washing and air drying are quick and easy.<br /><br />The infusion basket holds a fair amount of ingredients. It appears to have been designed for citrus or pulpy fruit (such as apple) wedges.  It will also accommodate most larger berries, although if you intend to add blueberries, I recommend arranging them in the center of the ingredients because when cut to release their juices parts can escape into the main chamber of the bottle. Also, the drinking spout is large and small ingredients will flow out.  For me I like that and view it as a feature, but some folks may not care for that characteristic.<br /><br />One thing to note is the release button only opens the cap after you have disengaged a U-shaped metal bail. There is no illustration of that in the instructions that are printed on the box, so if you are unfamiliar with this kind of mechanism you may be frustrated the first time you use it. I discovered this when a friend was toying with the bottle and complained that she could not open the lid.<br /><br />Overall, this has high capacity going for it, and it is absolutely leak-proof.

The lenses seem to be replaceable (but I'm not sure about this.) The lenses themselves are sharp, clear, and glare-reducing. There are vents in the arms to promote ventilation and prevent fogging.<br /><br />I wish the instructions had been clearer.  Also, for hiking and driving, they might not be the best. Because they sit high my nose and away from my face, they leave the bottom of my field of vision unfiltered.

Not heavy duty like the balls you use or see at a gym but adequate for home use. If you have kids around who may be tempted to use it for other things, it may not last as long as you'd like it to.<br /><br />The hand pump is probably the weakest part of the product. Although it does the job well and using it is almost exercise itself, the tube doesn't appear that it will last very long because it's so thin, especially at the end that attaches to the pump itself.

The textured base is perfect for keeping your child's riding foot in place. The size is just right, and I love that it will adjust as my granddaughter grows. She's really excited about it, and has had fun learning how to use it.<br />BAD: one of the handle tubes was too big for where it needed to be inserted into the frame. The whole scooter comes assembled, but broken down - you flip a lever to raise the long frame from the base, and you pull the handles out of an attached clip and then insert them into the metal tube (there is a photo on the product page of the collapsed scooter). I was totally confused, but checked and double-checked - one of the handles was both bigger than the other handle, and just too big too fit.

4737,1.0,Terrible Purchase of a home Treadmill Makes noises squeeking and clicking sound.,[[VIDEOID:58a724d1a5a1c78a092de4a36fddf332]] Purchased this treadmill even though I have seen some bad reviews on it. Mostly because of the Ifit membership required to activate. Myself I activated on ifit with no problems and the options are great for anyone trying to lose weight or need a little help or support. My issue is with the treadmill itself as you can tell its not a small price. But after we put it together the treadmill is constantly making a squeeking sound when you step on it to use it. It makes almost like a small chirping sound while using it as well. I have done research and have read to make sure its level which it is and to also make sure to possibly relube it which I have and nothing has helped.<br /><br />The sound is annoying and very frustrating knowing it is brand new and everything else seems to work I did purchase the 3 year warranty in which I plan on calling them and discussing this issue with them further. But it is very disappointing to order a good name brand product like this to already have an issue within 3 days of purchase smh. This will be the last product I ever purchase from Norditrac as it does not deliver the high end product I thought it would have. Very disappointed in this purchase and very upset that this was an issue right out of the gate with this product. We thought maybe it was unlevel but we leveled it completely and that is not a possible issue either. Hopefully after contacting them they will have a fix or solution to this issue. I will update this review later. I included 2 pictures and a short video so you can hear the sound it makes.,1,"['videoid', 'purchased', 'treadmill', 'even', 'though', 'seen', 'bad', 'review', 'mostly', 'problem', 'option', 'great', 'anyone', 'trying', 'lose', 'weight', 'need', 'little', 'help', 'support', 'issue', 'treadmill', 'tell', 'small', 'price', 'put', 'together', 'treadmill', 'making', 'sound', 'step', 'use', 'make', 'almost', 'like', 'small', 'sound', 'using', 'well', 'done', 'read', 'make', 'sure', 'level', 'also', 'make', 'sure', 'nothing', 'sound', 'annoying', 'brand', 'new', 'everything', 'else', 'seems', 'work', 'purchase', 'year', 'plan', 'issue', 'disappointing', 'order', 'good', 'name', 'brand', 'product', 'like', 'already', 'issue', 'within', 'day', 'purchase', 'last', 'product', 'ever', 'purchase', 'doe', 'high', 'end', 'product', 'thought', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'issue', 'right', 'product', 'thought', 'maybe', 'completely', 'possible', 'issue', 'either', 'fix', 'issue', 'update', 'review', 'later', 'included', 'picture', 'short', 'video', 'hear', 'sound', 'make']"

4748,5.0,100% cotton- perfection in a classic sweatpant!,"Incredible quality and made of the softest material,  these are legit sweatpants! Nothing synthetic or added to the mix- Believe it or not, these are 100% cotton and that’s not easy to find these days! Solid stitching, straight reinforced seams.. the attention to detail has not been overlooked. Constructed using a mid-weight fabric, these are reminiscent of what one would expect to find in a college bookstore. Best yet, these are sold at a price point of $30- a great price for such quality.. trust me, you won’t be disappointed.<br /><br />We chose XL in gray and the fit was good. Being the 2nd order from this brand, I noticed although these are adult sizes, items seems to be more inline with a “junior adult” physique.. For example, these are perfect for my 17yr. old son who hasn’t quite reached his adult frame. For reference: He is- 6’4”, 182lb, 33x36, active but not overly athletic. One who hasn’t reached his full filled-in build.. he’s a 17yr. old caught between a tween/man body! The sweatpants are stylish with a gradual taper from mid thigh to ankle removing a lot of excess bulk. This gives them a trendy “slim fit” look but, can also be quite beneficial while wearing during sport activity (excess material won’t hinder game/play.)<br /><br />I recommend washing on cold and line drying.. This will eliminate any possible shrinkage with cotton. After 6 washes.. so far, so good- we’ve had zero pilling! Although not extra deep.. the pockets are great for hand placement.. and can fit at least the smaller cell phone (we have 8+) or, car keys/ID. No! These pockets do not zip closed.. the only downfall I see!<br /><br />Overall, a great find and one I’d recommend without hesitation. The quality of material and craftsmanship is spot on and worth the purchase price. Being of such solid quality these boast longevity and the classic 100% cotton look is timeless!

The potential is there for this knife but there are a couple of serious shortcomings that make is very hard for me to recommend.<br /><br />I will get right to my main complaints: there is no safety stop lip at the base of the blade so if your hand slips off the handle, there’s nothing to stop it from slipping onto the blade and you’re going to slice your hand. And, the handle is hard plastic and very thin, making it very slippery, especially when wet. From a safety issue alone, this knife is not good.<br /><br />In addition, the sheath allows for attaching the knife to your belt, but it allows the handle to stick up completely over the belt so the handle is continually poking me in the side.<br /><br />On the plus side, this knife is wicked sharp, it seems to be well made, it has a serrated edge for sawing, it has a built-in bottle opener and it can be used to break glass in an emergency.<br /><br />All is not lost on this knife though the positives are outweighed by the negatives. This knife presents an easy path to cutting yourself even if you’re being somewhat careful, and that’s no good.

4768,3.0,"weaker than other brands, mild warmth but not enough to be a repurchase","Not as warm as anticipated. I rely on hand, toe, body warmers. I often use Hot Hands brand, but have successfully used off brands. I dont know why these dont get that warm. I have even used warmers well beyond their best by date and still had them work fine. These DO get warm, but the heat doesnt pump out. Very weak. Not a repurchase.<br /><br />I typically wear layers. A tank top, then a long sleeved top on top. Since these warmers are not meant to be used directly on skin, I stuck one on my tank top. When that didnt feel like anything, I then turned it around and stuck in on the inside of the long sleeved shirt (so the outer heat pad directed toward my body). Still nothing noticeable. If I touch it, it was warm, but I didnt feel a cozy radiating heat like I normally would with other body warmers. I even took it off, exposed it to air again, and put it back.

4789,4.0,less for camp more for everyday use (cold or w/ microwave),"I like the idea. If you are using this for home, office, hotel, on the run. For those applications you are likely to have food that doesn't need to be heated or you will have access to a microwave. Maybe even for camping, or day hike, so long as you are not looking to also cook with it- as it is not meant for flame or direct heat. For that, I prefer to pack a metal bowl and cup set.<br /><br />There are two ""plates"" at .75"" deep, and a ""bowl"" (or lid) that measures 1.5"" deep. The three items stack.<br /><br />There are 2 eating utensils. Spoon on one side, and a combo Knife and Fork on the other. The spoon and fork work fine. The knife is best for items you want to cut that don't need a lot of work to get it done. Softer, easier items are best.<br /><br />There are two cups. The base is a soft silicon that smooshes up inside. The lid/cap is attached.  It flicks open easily, yet doesn't snap tight (too bad). Comfortable enough to drink from it with cap open, or can keep it closed and drink from the small opening.<br /><br />The cups don't stand well on their own empty. They do fine with liquid inside.  One of my pictures has the pink cup leaning up against other stuff because it is empty. The green one is standing fine, but I have water poured inside.<br /><br />Everything stacks and fit together nicely. Needs harness to hold it all together.<br /><br />Nylon with mesh, draw string bag is just big enough to fit the stacked together and harnessed items.<br /><br />I tried this set at home with my lunch, so I could see how everything performed. I like the look of it, I like the materials used. I think this set would do well with an additional lid/bowl so there would be 1:1 for each set. Especially as a cup and a utensil fits nice in each plate, it would be nice to have an additional lid for one of the sets. This would allow the set to be parted out (say one for work, one for car) and/or as well as allow each user to have the exact same thing.

4795,2.0,I sooo wanted to like this bike bag,"This bike bag is wonderful but has a fatal flaw.  The straps that are on the underside to attach it to the bike rack are crap.  They are too long.  The velcro is placed too far away so that if you pull it to the tightness you need, the velcro misses itself entirely.  That pretty much renders it useless.  I've tried numerous fixes, short of cutting the strap and sewing it back together shorter, mostly because I don't have a sewing machine which you would need with the kind of pressure you have to put on it to make it tight.  Another thing is the placement of these straps makes it anything but quick release and quick re-attach.  As I live in a large city, I have to take the bag with me whenever I make a stop, and fiddling around underneath with hard to reach attachment points adds way more time to each stop.  The third thing is that those straps are of very poor quality.  The weave is loose and they are flimsy.  Which is strange because everything else about this bike bag is very well-made and well-designed.  In the final analysis, I gave up, attached a milk crate to the back of my bike, and I throw this bike bag in it.  Which pretty much invalidates the panier function I wanted.  Also, not the sleek sportive look I was going for, but it sure beats the frustration.",1,"['bike', 'bag', 'wonderful', 'flaw', 'strap', 'attach', 'bike', 'rack', 'long', 'velcro', 'far', 'away', 'pull', 'need', 'velcro', 'pretty', 'much', 'useless', 'tried', 'fix', 'short', 'strap', 'back', 'together', 'mostly', 'machine', 'need', 'kind', 'pressure', 'put', 'make', 'tight', 'another', 'thing', 'strap', 'make', 'anything', 'quick', 'release', 'quick', 'attach', 'live', 'large', 'take', 'bag', 'make', 'stop', 'around', 'underneath', 'hard', 'reach', 'point', 'add', 'way', 'time', 'stop', 'thing', 'strap', 'poor', 'quality', 'loose', 'flimsy', 'everything', 'else', 'bike', 'bag', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'designed', 'gave', 'attached', 'back', 'bike', 'throw', 'bike', 'bag', 'pretty', 'much', 'function', 'wanted', 'also', 'look', 'going', 'sure']"

It detaches easily by folding up the handles & can be carried into a store or wherever. When the handles are folded down, the basket is locked to the bracket, when they are extended up, they unlock. We added the small carabiner to keep the handle from being jostled by bumps allowing it to detach.<br />The mounting bracket attaches to the bike with nothing more than gravity & a lot of faith. We put the zip ties around the handlebar brackets to keep them from coming off on bumps. The bottom bracket uses a flimsy piece of velcro that broke immediately after the picture was taken & was replaced with yet another zip tie.<br />Once we got the mounts firmed up (mostly with a bunch of zip ties), the basket holds well & is useful.

I don't think it would take much to tear the material as it seems pretty thin, but that's what you get for lightweight and cheap.<br />What bothers me is the way it's designed. The plastic strap adjuster and the strap are designed in such a way that they chafe terribly on arms. It rests on the side of my boobs and my arm rubs against it, which makes for a very uncomfortable hike. I wouldn't take this longer than a shorter day hike the way it's chafing my arms and my husband will probably be the one carrying if he's with me. I have never had this problem with backpacks before, so it must be in the design somehow. Loosening or tightening didn't seem to make a difference. I guess that's what i get for buying a cheap backpack?<br />The water bladder is fine, but the mouthpiece is pretty tough to use. I'm used to a camelbak which is easy to bite and drink from, but this one you really need to use your teeth on it.

4867,1.0,I Should Get Paid For The Work I Had To Do To Make This Work,"I know.  There are some people out there who will get this item, have no issues with it and think it is marvelous.  I am not one of those people.  I had high hopes for this lounger, but my God, the stress I had to go through to make it work..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a very tight bag.  It is wound up tight and it has a clip to it.<br /><br />CLIP<br />The latch on the bag that you have to undo has a special button on it.  This button was turned around to face the rolled up bag, so I had no idea how to get it undone.  It took me 10 minutes to get the latch to work.  Finally it did.<br /><br />BAG DESIGN<br />This is a weird couch to be blunt.  All it is is clear plastic encased inside of ripstop nylon caseing.  There are two channels of plastic which need to capture air and a piece of mesh in between.<br /><br />On the end of the bag are flexible pieces encased in the ends which are supposed to be held open as you run through the area holding it up like a giant wind sock.  The idea is that these channels fill with air, you roll up the end and it is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />Yeah, if you like sweat running down your face and the neighbors wondering what the heck you are doing with this demented looking kite in your yard running around flapping like a sick bird.<br /><br />HOW IT REALLY WORKS<br />I took a HALF HOUR to try to get air into this thing.  It would twist and turn around itself every time I tried to fill it with air.  I could NOT get it to fill with air no matter what I did.<br /><br />My husband saw me struggling with this and came over with that knowing look that his stupid wife could not possibly understand how something this ingenious would work.  I gave it to him.<br /><br />A half hour later with all sorts of words I can not repeat, he said, ""How the heck is anyone supposed to do this without high winds?""<br /><br />All of a sudden, a huge breeze came up and we both had to hold this thing in the air, pried open at the mouth to get the air encased in it.  It didn't work GREAT, but at least we got it somewhat inflated.<br /><br />HOW TO SHUT THE CHAIR IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO CATCH AIR<br />Once we got some air into it, I rolled up the back as tight as I could.  My husband sat in it and flipped over.  He was very irritated and tried again.  He started to sink to the ground.<br /><br />WHAT IF IT IS NOT FULL ENOUGH?<br />I rolled this thing up four more times and then tried it. It was full enough to lay on it without being ejected cartoon style on the lawn.<br /><br />IF YOU GET IT INFLATED HOW IS IT TO LAY ON?<br />After over an hour of work with this stupid thing, I finally got it tight enough where I could lay on it and have it not be sinking.  Then it happened.  The stupid thing began to sweat under me. Yes, there is mesh in the center, but within five minutes, I was sitting in a pool of sweat.  After about 15 minutes I had to get up and wipe off the chair.  It was 77 degrees out and the sun was in and out a bit.<br /><br />STAKE<br />This comes with a stake to make it not blow away in wind.  If you plan to use this on a beach, good luck with that.  The sand won't hold this tiny spike.<br /><br />SEAMS<br />Another thing- once the chair had been sat in for a while, I noticed the seams were coming out- and pulling TERRIBLY.  This thing would not last if you tried to put up to 600 lbs in it- heck not even under 200 lbs would it last a really long time.<br /><br />COMFORT AND ELDERLY<br />There are two other things I want to rant about with this chair.  It recommends that it is supportive and comfortable (once you get it inflated) and it is good even for elderly.  Let me tell you this.  It is not that comfortable, and getting out of it is horrible.  If you have an elderly person you want to embarrass, this is the chair to use.  You might find them laying flat on their face unable to get up from their prone position once they manage to get out of this marvelous chair.<br /><br />PUTTING IT AWAY<br />Then my last rant is about the storage bag.  Trying to roll this monstrosity into the small roll that fits into the tight bag is yet another frustration with this thing.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As you can see, my experience with this chair is anything but stellar.  After working really hard with two people to get it inflated enough to use, the thing makes you sweat, and it is very hard to get out of.  It is not any kind of chair I would want to try to use without a high wind.  Then if you had high winds, you would not want to be laying in the thing, although it might blow your sweat away.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.  This experience was not good.

4884,4.0,"fold it narrow, scrunch it, or keep extra wide for most coverage. High compression","These are made well, and the colors are vibrant with various designs. When I see multi packs, I usually decide ahead of time how many I will actually like to use. Then I decide from there. Sometimes they are same as shown, sometimes different. These are same as shown in upper most picture. Since I could see the designs included, I knew there were a few I would really like, and the rest will be my less preferred headbands when it comes time to use one. Cute ones for heading out and about, less cute for doing gross chores.<br /><br />I have a big head- 23.75"", so I wasn't surprised when these fit a little more snug than I care for. But they fit. There is plenty of stretch. I really like that they are extra wide. I can simple fold them in half if I want a more narrow band, or scrunch them for cute casual look, or wear them full extended for the most coverage of forehead and hair.<br /><br />The material is dense. It is stretchy, but its a tight stretch some from the size, but much directly related to the material. It is cotton and spandex. No idea how much spandex, but I assume a higher amount because of the combo of stretch and snug fit (will stretch but fit snug i think regardless of head size)<br /><br />Well packaged. I think the boxing is cute. Small box, hinged lid, tissue covering rolled and labeled headbands. Just has pleasing appearance. Gift worthy if you know anyone that would like something like this.<br /><br />I always use sweat bands that serve as head bands. I have tiny hairs that drop down and annoy me, so I like to keep my hair pulled up off my face entirely with bands like this. Also works for use in doing make up, washing face, using face mask. If you use virtual reality and find yourself sweating under the googles, I like using bands such as this to help.<br /><br />One last use that I have is for keeping my visor on.

4889,1.0,Needs improvement,"Bought two, returned two. Different packages. The first one had a focus wheel (the large one) that would not stay on the focus adjustment knob - reason is the retention screw simply would not tighten enough to hold the wheel in place properly. Hence, avoid the packages with the focus wheel - it's useless.  The second one I bought, simple package with sunshade and dovetail rings, had a manufacturing defect where the front half of the scope wasn't joined correctly to the back half - I don't know if they use glue or it's finely screwed on, but the scope is canted, like a limp d. Getting a replacement, we'll see how it holds up. Overall, the glass seems good, but so many other things are off that it's hard to recommend. Quality control needs to step up  and catch these defects before they reach the customer.<br /><br />Update: received replacement for the second one, and that one TOO has the defect. I have never seen this with any other scope. Granted, this scope is silver so you see every little imperfection. It has to be a bad batch, but that means quality control is really off. Bottom line is, I’m keeping it because as far as silver color scopes go the choices are limited, and don’t feel like painting a higher quality one. To be fair, the glass is of decent quality so maybe end of day, the “paint doesn’t drive the car”. I just hope this canting doesn’t result in crooked vision affecting the poi adjustments.<br /><br />2nd Update: But wait, yet again like moth to (silver) flame I got another one, hoping this time it'll be OK - nope! On this one, someone forgot or plainly missed to wipe the inside of the viewfinder glass - see those concentric cirles and the ""glue""? smudge in the center of it? This is sloppy beyond belief. I'm done, I'll no longer buy anything WestHunter - they don't seem to have even a rudementary quality control - how can something so basic be missed?

4906,1.0,Works as a taillight but it's practically impossible to open to install or replace the batteries,"This is a 2.4 lux/4 lumen rain proof and splash proof bicycle taillight which takes 2 AAA batteries (not included). These batteries should provide 36 hours of illumination according to the package.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this light. First, it's practically impossible to remove the cover to insert the batteries. There's a notch at the bottom of the light that is used to open the compartment. I had to use a letter opener to pry it open while squeezing the top a bit. The force that had to be used damaged the plastic around the notch but did not affect the light's functionality. There are four plastic prongs that hold the top reflector onto the base and I can see these prongs breaking when opening or closing the compartment to replace the batteries.<br /><br />I have a Trek bike and it was difficult to position on my bike because the height of the light got in the way of the reflector that was already there. However, the mounting bracket is a typical bracket that clenches itself around the bike frame. The light clips onto the fastener and can be removed and used elsewhere, such as clipping onto a backpack or hat for use when walking.<br /><br />The light turns on via a button on the back. Only the top &#34;bulging&#34; part lights up as the bottom acts as a reflector.<br /><br />Because of the difficulty of opening this light and chance for breakage during battery replacement, I personally cannot recommend this.

4943,3.0,Decent First Paddle,"This is an OK paddle. I don't love it, I don't hate it. I think my favorite thing about this paddle is the colorful design on the paddle face.<br /><br />The face itself has almost no texture/grit, which as a brand new player may not matter, but will quickly become important after you get the hang of hitting the ball. The paddle face is approximately ~0.5 inches (~13 mm), which is on the thinner side. The upside of a thin paddle is that it provides more power than a thicker paddle, but on the downside, it will be tougher to spin with it (which is compounded by the fact the paddle face has no texture).<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like was the handle--it feels flat, like a piece of wood. Round handles are much more comfortable in my experience. The grip, however, was pretty nice. It is soft and comfortable to hold, and absorbs sweat pretty well. An added bonus with this paddle is that it comes with a paddle cover. Not a huge deal, but a nice touch nonetheless.<br /><br />My bottom line is that this is a decent first paddle. Otherwise, I would pass.",1,"['paddle', 'love', 'think', 'favorite', 'thing', 'paddle', 'design', 'paddle', 'face', 'face', 'almost', 'brand', 'new', 'may', 'matter', 'quickly', 'important', 'get', 'hang', 'ball', 'paddle', 'face', 'inch', 'side', 'thin', 'paddle', 'provides', 'power', 'thicker', 'paddle', 'spin', 'fact', 'paddle', 'face', 'another', 'thing', 'like', 'handle', 'feel', 'flat', 'like', 'piece', 'wood', 'round', 'handle', 'much', 'comfortable', 'experience', 'grip', 'however', 'pretty', 'nice', 'soft', 'comfortable', 'hold', 'sweat', 'pretty', 'well', 'added', 'paddle', 'come', 'paddle', 'cover', 'huge', 'deal', 'nice', 'touch', 'bottom', 'line', 'decent', 'first', 'paddle', 'otherwise']"

4946,5.0,Perfect weekend volleyball set. Easy setup.,"This is a perfect weekend at the beach or backyard bbq volleyball set. It is by no means as tough and rugged as pro volleyball equipment that you'd find in tournaments, or at school gyms. That said, it's a perfect set to use 4 or 5 times a year, then break down and store.  The set up is remarkably easy, it took us less than 15 minutes.  Everything is included in the bag. All the ropes are pre- strung. It's almost like it just unfolds and you just need to stake down poles. Each side has 3 tie-downs/support ropes. Each rope is connected to a metal ring. You slip that ring around a stake that you'll need to drive into ground. (See pic)<br />On the side of one of the poles is a counter, so you can easily keep score. (For some reason the kids thought this was the coolest part) Also included is a simple hand pump and white volleyball. The ball is shipped flat, so you have to pump it up yourself. Not a top quality ball, but it feels soft and it holds air for a long time.<br />The entire set breaks down fast. And it all fits into a durable zippered nylon bag that has a carrying handle. I really like the fact that it's so compact and simple. I feel that we will play more because it's so easy.",0,"['perfect', 'beach', 'set', 'mean', 'pro', 'equipment', 'find', 'school', 'gym', 'said', 'perfect', 'set', 'use', 'time', 'year', 'break', 'store', 'set', 'easy', 'took', 'less', 'minute', 'everything', 'included', 'bag', 'rope', 'almost', 'like', 'need', 'stake', 'pole', 'side', 'tie', 'support', 'rope', 'rope', 'metal', 'ring', 'slip', 'ring', 'around', 'stake', 'need', 'ground', 'see', 'side', 'one', 'pole', 'easily', 'keep', 'reason', 'kid', 'thought', 'part', 'also', 'included', 'simple', 'hand', 'pump', 'white', 'ball', 'flat', 'pump', 'top', 'quality', 'ball', 'feel', 'soft', 'hold', 'air', 'long', 'time', 'entire', 'set', 'break', 'fast', 'fit', 'durable', 'bag', 'carrying', 'handle', 'really', 'like', 'fact', 'compact', 'simple', 'feel', 'play', 'easy']"
4947,1.0,Lasted About Two Weeks,"My little kids were excited to have their very own trampoline. This trampoline was appropriately sized for my very small toddler (25 lbs.). But my 40 lb. six-year-old was far too big. The net around the trampoline came just below his shoulder. It also had a tendency to tip over. We had to clear the ground under it very well because the smallest stick or bump on the dirt would make it tip. After two weeks, my toddler falling into one of the posts made the post break off, leaving a jagged metal spot where it stood. There was no way to just take the net off the trampoline and keep using it because the posts that hold the net posts in place stick up about 6 inches around the edge of the trampoline, leaving metal posts around to fall on.

Based on several years of use and comparison to two other gauges and my car readouts, I trust my digital gauge on my bike floor pump for accuracy from psi ranges in the mid teens to the mid 50s. I took readings from several different pressures as benchmarked with my pump, and this analog gauge consistently read about 1 psi lower. That consistency is more than good enough for me. And by way of background, I’ve set up my mountain bike and gravel bike with tubeless tires, and I am particular about the pressures I run in different conditions.<br /><br />Also, this gauge has a rubberized face and comes in a sturdy and well padded case.

So for a spaced constrained home gym like mine, this is a disadvantage.<br />Main issue I had and reason why I'm returning is because I couldn't really used them due to a firmware upgrade issue. I received them during the weekend, assembled (minimum required), and tested them and they worked fine, when adjusting the knob, the necessary plates would be selected.<br />However, a couple of days later as I was ready for my first workout I downloaded the app and proceeded with registration and so on. As part of the process the firmware got updated. After that, the knob doesn't work and I can't adjust weight. If I cycle power I can adjust once or twice and then it becomes non responsive again. So I created a ticket for support, but got a response for a different product. Then I called in, we tried to do a hardware reset and it didn't work. So the agent said that she already had four similar calls, that I should either return or wait for a new base that can take several weeks.<br />Waiting for that long is not an option for me, so I have to return. I wish the company would give me another option, like replacing with a set of regular adjustable dumbbells instead of these smart ones.<br />It is concerning, considering this is a company that basically sells smart connected products, that they can have such low quality software upgrades that brick your device and then you have to wait weeks for it to be fixed.

I think the paint will wear quickly if carried around and used with a DS or portable device, Luigi isn't considered a ""top tier"" character in Smash Bros, and it just unlocks a Luigi themed racing suit in Mario Kart, (I don't have Hyrule so I'm not sure what it unlocks there), so unless you really like Luigi or are going to collect them all, you may want to consider other Amiibos.  And if you really want something pay attention to the upcoming releases and pre order.",1,"['got', 'store', 'doe', 'worth', 'let', 'inflated', 'price', 'release', 'quality', 'plastic', 'many', 'everyone', 'rate', 'update', 'available', 'store', 'still', 'far', 'tell', 'noticed', 'two', 'today', 'fact', 'still', 'see', 'online', 'well', 'see', 'price', 'returned', 'normal', 'good', 'using', 'add', 'think', 'paint', 'wear', 'quickly', 'around', 'used', 'portable', 'device', 'top', 'sure', 'unless', 'really', 'like', 'going', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'really', 'want', 'something', 'pay', 'release', 'order']"

The dumb*ss in the car heard me and then saw me and then stopped before we collided.  It is the second best investment next to my POC helmet.  This sounds like and is just as loud as those canned air horns you hear people use at football games.  I have one horn on my hybrid bike and my fat bike.  Note: the unit comes with an air charge in the can so when you push the lever on the horn the first time, you will jump.  I charge mine to 120 psi and I get a lot of little blasts or four to five reasonably long blasts.  I can use my mini hand pump or a gas station air hose to do a quick refill.

4997,3.0,Fun croquet set that seems high quality except that the mallets keep loosening from their handles,"This set includes:<br />- Six (6) all weather colored balls of one color of each (red, yellow, orange, blue, green, and black).<br />- Nine (9) all weather plastic coated metal wickets.<br />- Six (6) solid wood mallets with wooden handles (30.75 inches assembled) --one for each color. They have double metal locking joints and assembly is required each time.<br />- Two (2) 24&#34; wooden stakes with colored lines that match the colors of the balls and mallet handles.  NOTE that I received four (4) wooden stakes in my package (see picture).<br />- One carry case.<br />- One paltry instruction sheet.<br /><br />I had always wanted to play croquet and this is my first set. When I first opened the package, I was really impressed and considered this five stars for the price since it contains everything needed to play. In order to store all the items in the carry case, the set must be disassembled each time after play. What I mean by this is that the wooden handles have to be screwed and unscrewed from the mallet head. Since I live in a condo, I cannot leave this set assembled after playing as I have no garage to store this in and I have to remove the wickets from the complex's lawn when done with the game.<br /><br />After watching some how-to videos, my boyfriend and I played this. We had a lot of fun as it is a cross between golf and bocce ball to me.<br /><br />It was during play that we noticed a problem with this set. The biggest issue is that each wood mallet with its associated handle kept loosening up no matter how hard we tightened it. Several times we had to re-tighten the mallets. Also, after our game was over, we noticed that the plastic coating on the wickets was chipping off on the bottom and exposing the metal and this was the first time we used the set. I suppose this is to be expected, however..<br /><br />Overall, we enjoyed this game and the set seems to be good quality with the exception of the mallet head and its associated handle loosening up. It is for this reason only I rate this 3.4 stars. A really professional set would be more than double the price of this one. If I were in the market for a higher end set, I would look into this [[ASIN:B073YFZY9M Amish-made croquet set]].",1,"['set', 'six', 'weather', 'ball', 'one', 'color', 'red', 'yellow', 'blue', 'green', 'black', 'weather', 'plastic', 'metal', 'six', 'solid', 'wood', 'handle', 'inch', 'assembled', 'one', 'color', 'double', 'metal', 'assembly', 'time', 'two', 'stake', 'line', 'match', 'color', 'ball', 'handle', 'note', 'received', 'four', 'stake', 'package', 'see', 'picture', 'one', 'carry', 'case', 'one', 'instruction', 'sheet', 'always', 'wanted', 'play', 'first', 'set', 'first', 'opened', 'package', 'really', 'impressed', 'five', 'star', 'price', 'since', 'everything', 'needed', 'play', 'order', 'store', 'item', 'carry', 'case', 'set', 'must', 'time', 'play', 'mean', 'handle', 'head', 'since', 'live', 'leave', 'set', 'assembled', 'playing', 'garage', 'store', 'remove', 'done', 'game', 'watching', 'video', 'lot', 'fun', 'golf', 'ball', 'play', 'noticed', 'problem', 'set', 'issue', 'wood', 'handle', 'kept', 'matter', 'hard', 'several', 'time', 'tighten', 'also', 'game', 'noticed', 'plastic', 'bottom', 'metal', 'first', 'time', 'used', 'set', 'expected', 'however', 'overall', 'game', 'set', 'seems', 'good', 'quality', 'head', 'handle', 'reason', 'rate', 'star', 'really', 'set', 'double', 'price', 'one', 'higher', 'end', 'set', 'look', 'asin', 'made', 'set']"
4998,3.0,"It Works, Sort Of. . .","The towel does cool your neck and when it warms up from your body heat, something it does fairly quick because it doesn't breathe, all you need to do is give it a snap in mid air and as long as the towel is reasonably damp it will provide cooling. It doesn't drip, per say, but it will dampen a shirt if tucked under one.<br />I have three issues with this towel:<br />First, it smells funky. I've used it, rinsed it, wrung it three, four times and there's still that rubbery, plastic odor to deal with. It lessened some but not completely<br />Second, it feels kinda weird in the hand and initially on the neck. After you wear it for a while you learn to ignore the rubbery fabric on your skin.<br />Third, the container it comes in is small, it's not easy to get the towel back in to store it and if you don't get it back in a mostly air tight container where it will stay partially damp forever(ish). However, if you hang the towel across a bar and go off to bed. . . it dries as stiff as untanned leather. Wetting it restores suppleness but if you forget you practically have a board on your hand.<br />Something that just occurred to me. If you're putting this away damp after having been on your sweaty body what's the chance of unpleasant things growing in the damp nooks and crannies f the towel inside the plastic container. That has me somewhat concerned. make that four issues. Still it will cool you down at the neck or wherever you put it and it can be 'reactivated' numerous times and rewet as needed.",1,"['towel', 'doe', 'cool', 'neck', 'body', 'heat', 'something', 'doe', 'fairly', 'quick', 'doe', 'need', 'give', 'snap', 'air', 'long', 'towel', 'provide', 'doe', 'per', 'say', 'shirt', 'one', 'three', 'issue', 'towel', 'first', 'smell', 'used', 'three', 'four', 'time', 'still', 'plastic', 'deal', 'completely', 'second', 'feel', 'weird', 'hand', 'neck', 'wear', 'fabric', 'skin', 'container', 'come', 'small', 'easy', 'get', 'towel', 'back', 'store', 'get', 'back', 'mostly', 'air', 'tight', 'container', 'stay', 'however', 'hang', 'towel', 'across', 'bar', 'bed', 'dry', 'stiff', 'board', 'hand', 'something', 'putting', 'away', 'body', 'chance', 'thing', 'towel', 'inside', 'plastic', 'container', 'somewhat', 'make', 'four', 'issue', 'still', 'cool', 'neck', 'put', 'time', 'needed']"
